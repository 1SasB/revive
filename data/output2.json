        "Habitat and geographical distribution": "A. nilotica is widespread in the northern savanna regions, and its range extends from Mali to Sudan and Egypt. It requires a strong light environment for growth. Severe frost affects small seedlings as well as large trees. It is drought resistant and grows best on alluvial soils in plain, flat or gently undulating ground and in ravine areas. It is considered a serious weed in South Africa.\n\n\n\n",

        "Other parts used": "\n\nLeaf, aerial part, stem-bark, root- bark\n\n\n\n",
        "Definition of plant material of interest": "Acacia consists of fresh or dried fruit of Acacia nolitica (L.) Willd. ex Del. var. nolitica (Mimosaceae).\n\n\n\n",
        "Ethnomedical uses": "nilotica is used in many cultures to treat bronchitis, chest pains, colds, diarrhoea, dysentery, fever, haemorrhage, leprosy, eye disorders, pneumonia, sore throat (Chhabra and Uiso, 1991; Watt 1962); syphilis (Kambizi and Afolayan 2001; Watt 1962); oral candidiasis; fungal skin infections (Lev and Amar, 2002; Srinivasan et al., 2001); malaria and toothache (Jain et al., 2005; Kubmarawa et al., 2007). Bark decoction is used to treat  pre-, intra- and postpartum complications (Kaingu et al., 2011) and the hot decoction of the root bark is used for gastrointestinal complications and babesiosis (Nanyingi et al., 2008). Fruits are used against scabies (Lev and Amar, 2000).\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Chuabal et al. (2003) have reported the antiinflammatory and antiheminthic activities of the plant. Tannin-containing extracts showed algicidal and molluscicidal effects against the fresh water snails Bulinus truncatus and Biomphalaria pfeifferi (Ayoub and Yankov, 1985) and aqueous extracts exhibited antibacterial properties in vitro (Abd El Nabi et al., 1992). In vivo studies showed that the methanolic stembark, fruit and leaf extracts provided complete protection against castor oil-induced diarrhoea, which was comparable to the anti-diarrhoeal drug, loperamide (Agunu et al., 2005). These extracts (0.5 to 3.0 mg/ml) exhibited a dosedependent antidiarrhoeic effect on isolated rabbit jejunum with initial relaxation, which was quickly followed by contraction of the jejunum at 3.0 mg/ml (Agunu et al., 2005). Other studies have also shown that different extracts of the plant have antifungal and broad-spectrum antibacterial effects (Hamsa et al., 2006; Abd El Nabi et al., 1992; Srinivasan et al., 2001; Ahmad et al., 1998). Different extracts of the root bark and fruits are reported to have antifungal activity particularly against yeasts and Candida albicans (Gupta and Bilgrami, 1970; Sinha and Anjana, 1984; Almagboul et al., 1988; Runyoro et al., 2006). Niloticane, a diterpene isolated from the bark showed antibacterial activity against Grampositive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus (Eldeen et al., 2010). Sultana et al. (2007) also showed that the bark extracts have in vitro antioxidant capacity, whilst Shah et al. (1997) found the alcohol extracts to possess platelet aggregation antagonising effect in a dose-dependent manner. The methanolic extracts of the pods have been shown to be effective against HIV-PR (Bessong and Obi, 2006) and the fresh plant parts have been reported to be active against Hepatitis C virus (Hussein et al., 2000). Antiplasmodial activity of the ethyl acetate extract against different chloroquine resistant and sensitive strains of Plasmodium falciparum have been reported (ElTahir et al., 1999). Phenolic and polyphenolic-rich ether, ethyl acetate and acetone fractions from the bark demonstrated antimutagenic and cytotoxic effects in Ames assay (Kaur et al., 2005).\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nAn investigation to assess the anti-microbial effect of rinsing with Acacia nilotica L. extract containing mouth rinse on supragingival plaque formation and development of gingivitis in comparison to control mouth rinse formulation using thirty volunteers was carried out. All subjects received a full mouth scaling and root planning (SRP) until almost zero plaque index (PI) were reached. Plaque index, gingival index (GI), gingival bleeding index (GBI) and modified lobene stain index (MLSI) were recorded at day zero, one week and two weeks following therapy. The volunteers were allotted equally into three groups as follows: Experimental group used Acacia nilotica mouth rinse; Positive control group used 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX); Negative control group used a placebo. Samples of supragingival plaque were collected from each volunteer before SRP, and at one and two weeks after using mouth rinse.  The herbal mouth rinse exhibited less (PI), (GI). (GBI) values when compared to placebo, but higher values in comparison to (CHX). The microbial inhibition was less than (CHX) but significantly higher than placebo, suggesting its antimicrobial activity (ElMenoufy et al., 2010).\n\n\n\n",

In addition, chewing an acacia-based gum for 7 days has been shown to reduce mean gingival and plaque scores compared to a sugarfree gum; the total differences in these scores was significant (P < 0.05) between groups suggesting that acacia gum primarily inhibits the early deposition of plaque (Gazi, 1991).\n\n",

        "Habitat and geographical distribution": "\n\nA. digitata commonly grows in the thorny woodlands of the African savannas, which are characterised by low altitudes with limited annual rainfall such as the Sudano-Sahelian zone (600 to 900 mm annual rainfall). It is found in hot, dry woodland on stoney, well drained soils, in frostfree areas that receive low rainfall, but adapts to any soil (Le Flamboyant, 1993). A. digitata is resistant to fire, termite and drought, prefers a high water table and is very sensitive to waterlogging and frost. It is a protected species often planted and associated with human occupation (Giffard, 1974).\n\n\n\n",
        "Plant material of interest": "\n\nLeaf, fruit pulp\n\n\n\n",
        "Other parts used": "\n\nStem bark and root\n\n\n\n",
        "Definition of plant material of interest": "Baobab consists of the dried leaf or dried white fruit pulp of Adansonia digitata (Bombacaceae).\n\n\n\n",
        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nA. digitata is used to treat general worm infestations, diarrhoea and abdominal pain (Diehl et al., 2004). Root or stem bark decoction is used as a disinfectant for chronic wounds. Juice from fresh stem bark is applied to small inflammated boils, whilst a powder mixed with Lannea microcarpa seed oil is applied to large boils (Inngjerdingen et al., 2004). Stem bark decoction is administered orally to treat infectious diseases such \tas \tsexually \ttransmitted \tdiseases\n\n(Magassouba et al., 2007). A. digitata is used for the treatment of fever, diarrhoea, haemoptysis, hiccups and urinary and digestive tract disorders (Ribeiro et al., 2010; Van Wyk, 2008). Dried leaves are stored for 1-2 years in an airtight container pounded and strained and the resulting gum used as a remedy for tooth decay. Some healers recommend adding a dried snail shell before pounding the leaves. Decoction of the leaf is also used orally for the treatment of malaria (Nguta et al., 2010a; 2010b). In some parts of Africa, India, Sri Lanka and the West Indies malaria sufferers are said to take a mash containing dried baobab bark to treat the fever associated with the disease whilst the bark of the plant is used to treat tuberculosis, persistent cough, bronchitis and debility (Luo et al., 2011; Ribeiro et al., 2010).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Aqeous, methanol and acetonitrile extracts of the flower showed promising anti-fungal activity against Microsporum canis, Trichophyton rubrum and Epidermophyton floccosum (Locher et al., 1995). Deeni and Sadiq (2002) have reported the in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of the methanolic leaf extract. Leaf extracts also exhibited anthelminthic activities (Diehl et al., 2004). A. digitata leaves, fruit-pulp and seeds have shown antiviral activity against influenza virus, herpes simplex virus and respiratory syncytial virus and polio. The plant has analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Ramadan et al. (1993) found that the fruit pulp of baobab has similar anti-inflammatory properties to phenylbutazone in rats. Leaf powder is an antiasthmatic (Sallet et al., 1946). Intravenous administration of the leaf extract in animals caused a fall in carotid pressure and an increased respiratory rate with increasing amplitude. Several studies have reported the antioxidant capabilities of baobab fruit pulp, which is thought to be due its high vitamin C content (Lamien-Meda et al., 2008; Blomhoff et al., 2010). Besides having analgesic properties, the fruit pulp has also been shown to lower elevated body temperature without affecting normal body temperature (Ramadan et al., 1993). Al-Qarawi et al. (2003) have also reported that the fruit pulp has both hepatoprotective and hepatorestorative properties in Wistar male albino rats.\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nIn a clinical study involving 160 children aged 8 months, the efficacy of a traditional decoction of dried baobab fruit with water and sugar was compared with the WHO standard solution used to treat children with acute diarrhoea. It was observed that although the WHO solution was superior to the baobab mixture, there was no statistical difference between the two solutions in terms of duration of diarrhoea and weight gain. In addition the baobab decoction was found to be an excellent nutrient source, more economical than the WHO solution and also easily available to poor communities (Tal-Dia et al., 1997).\n\n\n\n",

It is used as a purgative, febrifuge, antienteralgic and antipyretic. In Nigeria the decoction of the plant is taken internally to treat diarrhoea and intestinal pain it is incorporated into traditional soaps prepared from the  ashes of plants such as  cocoa (Theobroma cacao) and from palm kernel shafts (Elaeis guinensis). In Kenya it is used as an antiasthmatic, antispasmodic and haemostatic, whilst in Brazilian folk medicine teas of A. conyzoides are taken as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-diarrhoeic. In Vietnam it is used for gynaecologic complaints. Other folkloric uses include anti-itch, antitussive, vermifuge, antirheumatic and anticaries.  The plant is most commonly used as a disinfectant and haemostic for wounds (Haensel et al, 1994).  The application of the leaf sap on the hands of card players is believed to improve their luck (Durodola, 1977).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "A. conyzoides has shown promising antiinflammatory, analgesic, antibacterial and wound healing properties in various experimental studies. Extracts of the crude root and aerial parts demonstrated neuromuscular blocking activity in isolated rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm. A. conyzoides\u2019s extracts showed calcium channel blocking activity comparable to that of verapramil (Achola and Munenge, 1997). Aqueous leaf extracts had effective analgesic action in rats (Bioka et al., 1993) and the ether and chloroform extracts showed activity against Staphylococus aureus in vitro (Durodola, 1977). Yamamoto et al (1991) found no antiinflammatory and analgesic properties in vivo, but an extract exhibited a partial agonist-type histamine-like activity in vitro. The methanolic extract of the whole plant showed antibacterial (S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) properties (Almagboul et al., 1985). Animal studies have demonstrated the herb\u2019s wound healing effects and an alcoholic extract caused a dose-dependent decline in radiation-induced mortality in vivo (Ganesh et al., 2003).

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nA. cordifolia is commonly used in traditional medicine in Africa, in combination with other plants; all the plants parts are used. The leaves are used in many African countries for the treatment of microbial, inflammatory, and stressrelated diseases (Neuwinger, 2000). The leaf decoction is taken for stomachache in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Burkina Faso, while a combination of the stem bark and the bark of Symphonia lobuliffera is used as an appetizer (Kerharo and Bouquet, 1950). The roots are used against leprosy (Abbiw, 1990) and the leaf powder has wound and ulcer cicatrisation properties (Kerharo and Bouquet, 1950). In Mali and Cote d\u2019Ivoire the plant is used to treat malaria (Mustofa et al., 2000).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "The leaf extracts demonstrated antimicrobial activities against Echerichia coli, Citrobacta diversus, Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella flexneri and Staphylococcus aureus (Tona et al., 1998). The antimicrobial activity of the stem bark has also been demonstrated against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Echerichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Ebi, 2000). The 50% ethanolic leaf extract showed an in vivo dose dependent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus; intraperitonial administration of the extract at 25 to 200 mg/kg,  signifiquantly increased the survival time of infected mice (Igbeneghu et al., 2007). Aqueous extracts were active against all the 21 bacterial strains tested and showed the highest levels of antibacterial activity with MIC's against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the range of 1.6-3.1 mg/ml (Pesewu et al., 2008). Barry et al. (2002) have also shown the plant\u2019s antifungual properties on Microsporon canis and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Extracts of the plant exhibited antitripanosomal activity against Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma bruce\u00ef at 200 \u00b5g/ml (Agbe et al., 1987) and the ethanol leaf extract showed an inhibitory activity against the K1 strain of Plasmodium falciparum with an IC50 value of 4.19 \u03bcg/ml (Togola, 2002). Ellagic acid, isolated from the same extract,  showed a moderate activity against P. falciparum, with IC50 values between 0.2 and 0.5 \u03bcmol (Banzouzi et al., 2002). The 80% methanolic extract exhibited a pronounced antiplasmodial activity against P. falciparum Ghanaian strain with IC50 values ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 \u03bcg/ml (Mesia et al., 2008). Several extracts prepared from the root bark exhibited an antiamoebic activity with an IC50 below 100 \u03bcg/ml (Tona et al., 1998). The plant also possess in vivo  antiinflammatory activity (Okoye et al. 2011; Mavar-Manga et al., 2008; Osadebe and Okoye, 2003), and a dose dependant antidiarrhoeal effect on mice (Agbor et al., 2004). Olaleye et al., (2006) reported the in vivo hepatoprotective activity of the hydro alcoholic leaf extract.  The plant also afforded protection against oxidative stress (Olaleye and Rocha, 2007); the polyphenols obtained from the ethyl acetate extract showed potent antioxidant and anti elastate activities (Kouakou-Siransy et al., 2010). Umukoro and Aladeokin, (2010) showed that oral intake of the leaf extract at 100-400 kg/kg had anti-stress/anti-fatigue properties in vivo. The methanolic leaf extract at 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg had antiulcer properties (Nguelefack et al., 2005). Ayisi and Nyadedzor, (2003) reported a significant antiviral activity on the replication processes of HIV-1. Histological changes in the pancreas was observed following administration of ethanolic leaf extract in alloxan-induced diabetic rats (Eliakim-Ikechukwu and Obri, 2009). The plant may be effective in increasing the elastic recoil of the aortic wall and may therefore reduce blood pressure (Eliakim-Ikechukwu and Obri, 2009). The flavonoid-rich fraction of extracts demonstrated an immunostimulant effect (Nworu et al., 2010a and Nworu et al., 2010b).\n\n\n\n",

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nGarlic is cholesterol-lowering, antihypertensive, anti-coagulant, anti-diarrhoeal, anti-dysenteric,\n\n\n\n\n\nimmune stimulant, stomachic, sudorific, expectorant, anthelmintic, counter-irritant, diuretic, broad spectrum antibiotic and anthelmintic. It is used externally for arthritis, corns, warts, neuralepia (Elujoba and Olawode, 2004; Gill 1992; Adjanahoun et al., 1991), fever, cough, flatulence, ulcer, hoarseness, bronchitis and other respiratory problems, skin diseases, burns, earache and tonsilitis, rheumatism, tuberculosis, typhoid, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, hyperlipidaemia and in the prevention of atherosclerotic (age-dependent) vascular changes (WHO, 1999).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Several scientific studies have shown that garlic has antihyperlipidaemic, antihypertensive and anticoagulant properties (Auer et al., 1990; Broche et al., 1990; Barrie et al., 1987). The herb\u2019s many therapeutic actions are attributed to the compound allicin and its metabolites. For example allicin and its corresponding sulphide inhibit the proliferation of several human nonleukaemia malignant cells in vitro. In vitro studies\n\nhave shown that ajoene possesses antithrombotic, anti-microbial and cholesterol lowering properties; ajoene exhibited inhibitory effects on platelet activation (Apitz-Castro et al., 1986), platelet binding to damaged blood vessel wall (Apitz-Castro et al., 1994) and thrombus formation (Apitz-Castro et al., 1992). It also prevented platelet loss from the blood, inhibited the lipooxygenase pathway, tyrosine phosphatase activity in human platelets (Srivastava and Tygi, 1993) and lowered cholesterol biosynthesis (Gebhardt et al., 1994). The compounds, diallyl disulphide and diallyl trisulphide possess antiplatelet aggregation and antithromboxane formation properties (Bordia et al., 1998).  Aqueous and organic garlic extracts inhibited platelet aggregation in vivo (Mohamed and Woodward, 1986). Garlic extracts reduce accumulation of cholesterol in blood vessels and the development of arteriosclerotic plaques in arterial wall in cholesterol-fed rabbits (Koscielny et al., 1999; Effendy et al., 1997). The extracts also exhibited anti-hypertensive effects, increased anticlotting activity, decreased blood viscosity, and improved cardiovascular function (Kendler, 1987). Garlic oil produced a marked reversal of the metabolic changes associated with isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction (Saravanan and Prakash, 2004). Garlic extracts have shown larvicidal properties against Anopheles and Culicine larvae and high inhibitory activity against a range of pathogenic bacteria and fungus (Benkeblia 2004). Ajoene exhibited anti-mycotic, anti-microbial and anti-viral activities. Other in vitro and in vivo studies have also shown that garlic has broad spectrum antifungal effects (Davies and Perrie, 2003) and exhibited a synergistic activity with amphotericin B in inhibiting fungal growth (Tansley and Appleton, 1975). Extensive scientific investigations have shown that various commercial garlic products possess antiviral activities against a range of viruses including herpes simplex virus Types 1 and 2, influenza A and B viruses, human cytomegalovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, rhinovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), viral pneumonia and rotavirus. Allicin has been shown to have antibacterial activity (Cavallito and Bailey, 1944).  Numerous epidemiological, clinical and laboratory studies have demonstrated the role of garlic in cancer prevention (Bianchini and Vainio, 2001; Dorant et al., 1996). Garlic oil, its powder and chemical constituents exhibited potent antibacterial effect on Helicobacter pylori, which may explain its supposed protectective effect against gastric cancer. The herb\u2019s chemopreventive properties have been attributed to the organosulphur compounds, which modulate the activity of several metabolising enzymes that activate or detoxify carcinogens and inhibit the formation of DNA adducts in several target tissues (Bianchini and Vainio, 2001). Diallyl disulfide has been shown to exhibit potent chemopreventative activity against colon, lung, and skin cancers.\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nGarlic powder preparations have been shown to have lipid-lowering potential but decreased plasma viscosity, tissue plasminogen activator activity and the haematocrit level; increased the mean diameter of the arterioles by 4.2% and venules by 5.9% as compared with the controls; increased capillary erythrocyte flow rate and decreased plasma viscosity and plasma fibrinogen levels; caused reduction of serum lipid concentrations; significantly increased tissue plasminogen activator activity as compared with placebo; platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate and collagen was significantly inhibited 2 and 4 hours after garlic ingestion and remained lower for 7 to 14 days after treatment; decreased the percentage of circulating platelet aggregates and spontaneous platelet aggregation as compared with the placebo group and also decreased the average blood glucose (WHO, 1999). Several clinical reports and meta-analyses have revealed the cholesterol-lowering effects of raw garlic and some garlic supplements. It has been shown that garlic can decrease low-density lipoproteins and increase high-density lipoprotein levels (Ernst, 1987; Chang and Johnson, 1980). Topical application of ajoene produced significant clinical response in patients with skin basal cell carcinoma. Garlic was shown to stimulate immune effector cells including T- and natural killer cells (Bianchini and Vainio, 2001).\n\n\n\n",

The stem bark is commonly used to treat malaria (Idowu et al., 2010; Titanji et al., 2008). An infusion of the bark is used as antivenom for snake bites; it is also used in treating painful micturation and rheumatic conditions (Asuzu and Anaga, 1991). The root and stem bark infusion is taken as a remedy for asthma. A liquid made from the stem bark and leaves is drunk to treat impotence. In Ghana, it is given for toothache and to women after delivery to aid in expelling the placenta. In Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Burkina Faso, it is applied topically to reduce oedema and to clean suppurate sores and exposed fractures. In Nigeria, it is used for ulcers and in Cameroon and Liberia as a remedy for snake bite and arrow poison.\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "The stem bark of A. boonei has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities (Olajide et al., 2000). It exhibited blood schizonticidal activity on the chemosuppression obtained during the 4 day early infection test. A significant (p<0.05) activity was also recorded during established infection, which was comparable to the standard drug (chloroquine, 5 mg/kg/day) in the investigation carried out by Iyiola et al., (2011). Aqueous extract of the herb had a contractile effect on both guinea pig ileum and rat stomach strip in vivo; the effect was more pronounced on rat stomach strip than on guinea pig ileum (Taiwo and Makinde, 1996). The stem bark extracts showed in vitro anti-complement (Taiwo et al.,1998), antiarthritic and analgesic effects in animal studies. The methanolic stem bark extracts inhibited carrageenan-induced paw oedema, cotton pellet granuloma and acetic acid induced vascular permeability (Olajide et al., 2000). The alcoholic extract demonstrated protection against egg white-induced rat hind paw oedema (Osadebe, 2002). Extracts of A. boonei have potential antihelminthic effects by the ability to inhibit glutathione S-transferases from parasitic nematodes (Fakae et al., 2000). The insecticidal properties of the aqueous extracts of the leaf and stem bark against the pink borer, Sesamia calamistis Hampson (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a major pest of maize have been demonstrated; both leaf and stem bark extracts caused a significant reduction in the weight of the larvae in a dose-related manner. (Oigiangbe et a.l, 2007). The antioxidant properties of A. boonei have been reported by Akinmoladun et al. (2007) and Taiwo et al., (1998) also investigated the activity of the stem bark on human complement and polymorph nuclear leucocytes. The nephrotoxicity caused by the extract in guinea pigs and the reproductive effect of the methanolic extract in male rats have been reported. The extract was also shown to lower cholesterol level and lipoprotein cholesterol significantly, at p< 0.05 in animals administered with a dose of 50 mg and 200 mg/kg body weight (Oze et al., 2007; 2008; Raji et al., 2005).

        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Several pharmacological studies have been conducted to validate the medicinal properties of A. indica. Some neem compounds have been shown to possess a dose-dependent anti-feedant effect (Mitchell et al., 1997). The leaves and stem bark of A. indica are used as antimalarial agents and their effectiveness has been confirmed by several \tlaboratory \tstudies \t(Aladesanmi \tet al.,1988; \tEkanem \t1978). \tThe \tantimalarial properties have been variously attributed to nimbolide (Rochanankij et al., 1985) and another limonoid, gedunin (Khalid and Duddeck, 1989). Iwu and his co-workers (1986) suggested that neem extracts exerted their antimalarial action by causing a redox perturbation through the imposition of a very strong oxidant stress on the malaria parasites. In another study, ball shaped wood scrappings soaked in 5% neem oil diluted in acetone and placed in water storage overhead tanks controlled the breeding of Anopheles stephensi and Aedes aegypti in 45 days (Nagpal et al., 1995). The oil components, particularly azadirachtin, have pesticidal potential (Koul et al., 1990; Schmutterer et al., 1990; Tanzubil et al., 1990). Neem limonoids have larvicidal, pupicidal, adulticidal and antiovipositional activity and can therefore be beneficial in mosquito control programmes (Nathan et al., 2005). The antiinflammatory properties of the plant have also been demonstrated in various studies. The watersoluble part of the alcoholic leaf extract showed antiinflammatory activity in the cotton pellet granuloma assay in vivo (Chattopadhway, 1998), antioxidant, hepatoprotective (Bhanwra et al., 2000), anti-ulcer (Dorababu et al., 2004), hypoglycaemic and negative chronotropic and inotropic properties (Khosla et al., 2000). The leaf extract exhibited equipotent cardioprotective activity on isoprenalin induced myocardial necrosis in experimental animals as compared to vitamin E (Peer et al., 2007). Oral intake of doses of 10-200 mg/kg of neem leaf extract produced anxiolytic effects comparable to that induced by diazepam (Jaiswal et al., 1994). A dosedependent hypotensive effect by the hydroalcoholic leaf extract has been reported (Chattopadhyay, 1997; Khanna et al., 1995). Oral administration of the leaf extracts reduced blood sugar levels in normal and streptozocin-induced diabetic models, with the hypoglycaemic effect comparable to glibenclamide (Khosla et al., 2000). The leaf extract blocked the effects of adrenaline on glucose metabolism and reduced peripheral glucose utilization in diabetic and normal rats (Chattopadhyay, 1996). An investigation of A. indica\u2019s effects on cerebral reperfusion injury and long term cerebral hypoperfusion based on the reported antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic properties of the herb showed that administration of 500 mg/kg/day for 15 days significantly reduced hypoperfus on induced functional disturbances such as anxiety, learning and memory impairment (Yanpallewar, 2005).  Neem extracts exhibited a dose-dependent antigastric ulcer activity in stressed rats. The extracts caused a decrease in ethanol induced gastric mucosal damage, an increase in the amount of adherent gastric mucus in stressed animals and also demonstrated significant anti-histaminic potential (Garg et al., 1993).  Bandyopadhyay et al., (2002) investigated the gastro-protective properties of the stem bark extract of A. indica and attributed it to the ability to inhibit acid secretion via blockage of H+/K+-ATPase activity as well as the inhibition of oxidative damage of the gastric mucosa by blocking lipid peroxidation and scavenging endogenous hydroxyl radicals. Aqueous leaf extract was found to lower raised levels of serum liver enzymes and paracetamol induced liver necrosis (Bhanwra et al., 2000).  Khanna et al., (1995) observed analgesic and sedative properties in vivo in A. indica extracts. Hydroalcoholic leaf extract caused a dosedependent hypotensive effect (Chattopadhway, 1997) and oral administration of low doses (10200 mg/kg) also showed anxiolytic effect comparable to that induced by diazepam (Jaiswal et al., 1994). Oral administration of methanolic extract had significant antibacterial activity against the multi-drug-resistant Vibrio cholerae in mouse (Thakurta et al., 2007). The ethanolic leaf extract demonstrated a much stronger antidermatophytic action compared to the aqueous extract in vitro (Venugopal and Venugopal, 1994), while the leaf, bark, cake and oil of the plant exhibited both dose and time dependent molluscicidal activities (Singh et al., 1996). The ethanolic extracts of the seed have been shown to have anthelmintic effects (Hordegen et al., 2006). In vitro studies showed that a herbal formulation, praneem, containing purified extracts of neem tree was effective against HIV and sexually transmitted disease pathogens, and also possessed contraceptive activity (Joshi et al., 2005). The immune stimulating effects of the leaf extracts have been demonstrated in vivo (Ray et al., 1996). The extracts potentiated antibody titres following typhoid H. antigen immunisation and induced delayed hypersensitivity following administration of tuberculin and DNCB to animals. Neem ethanolic extract has been shown to cause cell death of prostate cancer cells by inducing apoptosis (Kumar et al., 2006). Haque and Baral (Haque and Baral, 2006) have also shown that pretreatment of mice with neem leaf preparation causes prophylactic growth inhibition of murine Ehrlich\u2019s carcinoma and B16 melanoma. The methanol extracts of the leaf also stimulated stem cell reproduction in vitro (Gonzalez-Garza, 2007).\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nTopical application of a cream of A. indica on exposed body parts at the rate of 2.0 gm/person afforded protection against Aedes, culex and Anopheles mosquitoes (Dua et al., 1995). In human trials, extracts stimulated humoral immunity by increasing antibody levels and cell mediated immunity by increasing total lymphocyte and T-cell count in 21 days (Ansari et al., 1997). In a study conducted on males aged between 20-30 years over a 6-week period, dental gels containing neem extract were shown to have the ability to reduce plaque index and bacterial count than that of the control group (Pai et al., 2004).\n\n\n\n",

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nIn the Sahel, the leaves and fruits are used as food during the dry season and during lean periods. The leaves are dried and processed into powder for use in preparing sauce (Cook et al., 1998; Lockett et al., 2000). Edible oil is extracted from the kernels (Kamel and Koskinen, 1995). The fruit extract is added to porridge and eaten by nursing mothers to stimulate milk production, and the nuts are eaten to treat pain and discomfort associated with excessive intestinal motility and bloating (Lockett et al., 2000). B. aegyptiaca is one of the most palatable forage species for domestic grazing animals (Toutain, 1980; Savadogo, 2004). The root bark is crushed, added to water, soaked and drunk for its purgative effect (Koch et al., 2005). The seeds are used to treat cancers and hydrocoele (Abubakar et al., 2007). The stem and root barks are powdered and mixed with other species, and then boiled with water for use against oral candidiasis (Runyoro et al., 2006a). The stem bark is macerated in warm water, and the resulting extract taken for asthma, dry cough and chest infections (Maregesi et al., 2007) Some medicinal preparations are made with essential oils extracted from parts of B. aegyptiaca (Said et al., 2002). The leaves of the plant and young branches are macerated and applied fresh as poultice on wounds (Said et al., 2002). The powdered root of the plant is dissolved in water,\n\n\n\nand then used as a bath to treat measles. It is  also taken as tea against uterine fibroids (Tabuti et al., 2003), or made into a paste and applied to bleeding gums or inserted into the cavity of painful tooth three times per day until recovery (Tapsoba and Deschamps, 2005).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "\n\nThe whole plant is used as antiparastic, antihelminthic, \tantipyretic, \tfish \tpoison, abortifacient and molluscicide (Iwu, 1993). A dose of 20 mg/kg of the aqueous extract of the fruit mesocarp was as effective an antihelminthic against the worm Fasciola gigantica as a 9 g/kg dose of albendazole (Koko et al., 2000) and 200 mg/kg of the same extract was also effective against Schistosoma mansoni infected mice (Koko et al., 2005). The fruit mesocarp extract also showed significant antidiabetic activity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The effect has been attributed to the steroidal saponins (Kamel et al., 1991).The mixture of saponins isolated from the seeds, balanitines 6 and 7, has anti-cancerous activity in human cells (Gnoula et al., 2008).

        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "A crude extract of the plant as well as pure rutin, lowered the fasting blood glucose (FBS) of New Zealand white rabbits by up to 20% within 30 minutes of administration, rising to 35% within one and a half hours, and remaining at this level for up to 3 hours (Addae-Mensah and Munenge, 1989). It was observed that the extracts were more effective than the normal dose of the antidiabetic drug, glibenclamide, (0.13 mg/kg), but were less effective than insulin. However, in a manner statistically similar to insulin, the rutincontaining extract was able to inhibit artificially induced acute hyperglycaemia. A daily administration of a leaf decoction of the plant resulted in significant reduction of blood sugar levels (Iwu, 1986; Githens,1949). The leaf extracts showed hypoglycaemic effects, but were less effective in alloxan-induced diabetes (Githens, 1949; Iwu, 1980, 1986). Aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the plants have been shown to have antisickling activity (Mpiana et al., 2007). Extracts of the plants have shown cytotoxic and cytostatic activity (Rashid et al., 2000). Extracts of B. ferruginea have shown antimicrobial, antiHIV and antispasmodic activities (Cimanga et al., 1999; Akinpelu and Olorunmola, 2000; Muanza et al., 1995; Onoruvwe et al., 2001). The biflavanol and the quinic acid derivatives have been shown to inhibit the complement system (Cimanga et al., 1999; Stryer, 1995). The flavonoids quercetin, quercitrin and rutin have also been found to have antiviral effects against coxsackie, Herpes simplex, measles, parainfluenza and polio viruses (Addae-Mensah, 1992).  B. ferruginea\u2019s flavonoids showed xanthine oxidase inhibiting and superoxide scavenging activity at very low (micromolar) concentrations in vitro (Cimanga et al., 2001; Gabor, 1986). The ethyl acetate, hexane and methanol leaf extracts have all been shown to be effective against Bacillus subtilis, Echerichia coli, Pseudomonas frutescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis (Talla et al., 2002) while the aqueous and ethanolic powdered bark extracts were found to exhibit antifungal activity against Candida albicans, and antibacterial activity against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. lactis and S. pyogenes (Irobi et al., 1994). The aqueous extract of the stem bark caused a significant inhibition of the carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema, but the activity diminished in the mouse paw oedema. The extract also suppressed the granulomatous tissue formation characteristic of chronic inflammation (Olajide et al., 1999). Aqueous extracts of the stem bark showed antiinflammatory activity possibly mediated through down-regulation of TNF\u03b1 (Olajide, et al, 2003). Six African medicinal plants including Azadiractha indica, B. ferruginea, Commiphora molmol, Garcinia kola and Curcuma longa demonstrated antithrombotic effect in vivo (Olumayokun, 1999). The effect of the plant extract on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock and vascular permeability on the dorsal part of mice skin, showed that pretreatment with about 10-80 mg/kg of the extract inhibited the septic shock syndrome in mice in a dose-dependent manner, with an 80 mg/kg dose found to be as effective as 100 mg/kg of the drug pentoxifylline. The same dosage range of the extract (10-80 mg/kg) also reduced LPS-induced dye leakage in the skin of mice. Ethanolic leaf and stem bark extracts showed neuromuscular activity (Onoruvwe et al., 2001; 1994). Extracts of the plants have shown cytotoxic and cytostatic activity (Rashid et al., 2000).\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nAdministration of a leaf decoction to a 49 year old female diabetic patient caused her fasting blood sugar level to fall from 242 mg/dl to about 120 mg/dl after 12 weeks, remaining at this level for eight weeks (Addae-Mensah, 1992). A 45-year old hypertensive woman, who had diabetes diagnosed on routine examination had her fasting blood sugar level of 370 mg/dl reduced to 250 mg/dl after one week and continued to fall until it normalised after eleven weeks on immediate administration of B. ferruginea. No medication was prescribed for her hypertension, but her blood pressure fell from 180/90 to 140/90 during the treatment period (Addae-Mensah, 1992; Ampofo, 1977). Aqueous extracts of the leaves were able to normalise the fasting blood glucose levels and helped in eliminating glycosuria of patients with maturity onset diabetes (Iwu, 1993).\n\n\n\n",

        "Definition of plant material of interest": "Pawpaw consists of leaf or fruit or root of Carica papaya L. (Caricaceae).\n\n\n\n",
        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nThe uses of the plant are numerous (African Pharmacopoeia, 1985; Ake Asse, 2001). The infusion of fresh or dried leaves is used to treat against febrile illness. The leaf decoction is used to treat hernia, malaria, urogenital pain, gonorrhoea and cancer. Fumes from the leaves are also used to treat asthma. The root paste is dissolved in warm water and used as an enema to treat abdominal pain. It is also mixed with palm oil and used as a poultice to treat whitlow. The root is macerated in cold water and used as a mouthwash against dental caries. The macerated roots are also used orally against urethritis (painful urination), typhoid, fever, and as a laxative. The roots may also be macerated in palm wine or decocted and drunk to treat dysentery and gonorrhoea. The roots and leaves are used as diuretics. The decoction of the unripe fruit is a remedy for jaundice, sickle cell anaemia and hepatitis. The crushed unripe fruit is applied topically to treat boils and the infusion of the dried seed powder is taken on an empty stomach as an anthelmintic.\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "\n\nMany scientific studies have been undertaken to validate some of the plant\u2019s much-acclaimed pharmacological actions including antimicrobial (amoebicide, bacteriostatic); stomachic, vermifuge; galactogogue; oxytoxic; digestive; styptic; wound-healing and carminative (GHP 1992; Pamplona-Roger, 1998). Alcohol and butanol extracts of the dried leaves showed spasmolytic activity on isolated guinea pig ileum (Kambu et al., 1990). The ethanol extract of the dried leaf administered intraperitoneally to rats showed an analgesic, anticonvulsant, skeletal muscle relaxant, positive chronotropic and tranquilizing effects (Gupta et al., 1990). At low dose, carpaine reduces heart contractions and thus lowers blood pressure, but at high doses, it produces vasoconstriction (Oliver-Bever, 1960). The alkaloid of leaves, carpaine showed diuretic and amoebicidal properties and the hydroalcoholic extract of the root has shown in vitro activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Caceres, 1992; Caceres et al., 1995). The purified protein fractions obtained separately from fresh endocarp, epicarp, seed, fruit and fresh leaves showed in vitro activity against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella typhimurium (Argueta,1994; Emeruwa, 1982), whilst the pure methanolic fruit extract showed anti-inflammatory effect (Yasukawa et al., 1993). Osato et al. (1993) also reported the in vitro bacteriostatic properties of the juice from the pulp of unripe fruit and seed against Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and\n\nStaphylococcus aureus. Extracts from the same parts also showed antioxidant activity comparable to those of soybean paste miso, rice bran and baker's yeast (Osato et al., 1993). The 95% ethanolic root extract showed antibacterial activity in vitro against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (George and Pandali, 1949); the aqueous extract had in vitro anticandida effect (Gundidza, 1986). Latex from different parts of the plant has been shown to possess in vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans (Giordani et al. (1996; Giordani et al., 1991). Chen et al (1981) found that the latex of the green fruit afforded protection against stomach ulcers by reducing histamine-induced acid secretion in rats (Chen et al., 1981). The milky juice of the unripe fruits contain the proteolytic enzyme \u201cpapain\u201d, which is composed of the compounds papain and chymopapain (Oliver-Bever, 1960). Papain\u2019s tenderising properties, usually when combined with alkali (e.g. borax or potassium carbonate), have been utilised in the treatment of boils, corns, cutaneous tubercles, eczema, freckles, sinuses, warts and tumours. It has the ability to coagulate milk and to digest the fibrous tissue of flesh in both acid and alkali media and has been used to treat ulcers and as an anti-inflammatory agent to reduce swelling, fever and adhesions after surgery.

        "Safety data": "\n\nAnimal studies in male rats (p.o) showed that the LD50 of the aqueous leaf extract was > 3000 mg/kg. There was no evidence of clinical toxicity in the 24-hour monitoring following single dose treatment of 300-3000 mg/kg. Repeated dosing for 14 days did not affect the blood and its cellular elements. Liver and renal function was also normal.  Based on this study there is no safety concern in the use of the aqueous extract of Carica papaya. The ethanol extract of the green fruit administered intraperitoneally into mice gave an LD50 of 325.2 mg/Kg (Nahrstedt, 1987). Intravenous administration of chymopapain gave LD50 of 79 mg/kg in mice, 120 mg/ g in rats, 15 mg/kg in rabbits and 16.7 mg/kg in dogs. After injection of in situ chymopapain for the treatment of herniated discs, anaphylactic shock was observed in 1% of patients (Moneret Vautrin et al., 1985). Oral administration of 10ml/kg of the aqueous extract of the root (10 g macerated in 500 ml of water) to mice for 14 days showed no obvious signs of toxicity\n\n(Sripanidkulchai et al, 2001). A preparation of the fruit applied to the lower back (2 g/50 cm2) of rabbits for five consecutive days did not cause dermal irritation (Garcia-Gonzalez et al., 2001), but the aqueous seed extracts produced irreversible infertility in male albino rats due to decreased sperm motility (Charles, 1988).\n\n\n\n",

        "Adverse effects": "\n\nIn excessive doses, the extract of the plant can cause irreversible uterine tocolysis probably due to a toxic effect of benzyl isothiocyanate in the myometrium (Adebiyi et al., 2003). The plant is well tolerated in children (Starley et al., 1999), however, anaphylactic reactions to papain have been reported (Duke, 1985). The clinical symptoms of allergy to papain have been reported in some patients (De Clerck et al., 2007). Hepatotoxicity of the methanol extract of the seed has been reported (Udoh and Udoh, 2005; Adebiyi and Adaikan, 2005). Latex containing papain has been reported to induce chest pain, gastritis, rhinitis, yellowing of the palms, skin irritation and blistering, anaphylactic shock and severe asthma (Blanco et al., 1998, Blumenthal et al. 1998; Badin et al., 1978).\n\n\n\n",

        "Vernacular names": "\n\nNigeria: Yoruba \u2013 Kinin\n\n\n\n",
        "Description of the plant": "\n\nThe genus Cinchona pubescens, among about forty species in the family Rubiaceae, is native to the tropical Andes forests of western South America but now widely cultivated in many tropical countries for its market value and particularly due to the content of quinine, an antimalarial constituent. Large shrubs or small tree with evergreen foliage, growing to 15-20 m high; leaves are opposite, rounded to lanceolate and 10 \u2013 40 cm long; the tree produces white, pink, or yellow flowers in terminal panicles; fruit is a small capsule containing numerous seeds.\n\n\n\n",
        "Habitat and geographical distribution": "The plant originated from South America, and was introduced and cultivated (at an altitude of between 600-3300 m) in the humid tropics of Africa and Madagascar (African Pharmacopoeia, 1985).\n\n\n\n",
        "Plant material of interest": "\n\nDried stem bark\n\n\n\n",
        "Definition of plant material of interest": "\n\nCinchona consists of the dried stem bark of\n\nCinchona pubecens Vahl. (Rubiaceae)\n\n\n\n",
        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nCinchona originated from the Countess of Chinchon, wife of a Viceroy of Peru, who was cured of a type of malaria fever with the bark of the cinchona tree in 1638. The name cinchona comes from \"kina-kina\" meaning \"bark bark\" in Peru. Quinine, obtained from the bark, was first proposed for sale in England in 1658 and was made official in the British Pharmacopoeia in 1677. The cinchona bark was included in many formulations in Europe, such as \"Countess's powder\", \"Jesuit's powder\". Besides malaria, the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbark was also used to treat fever, indigestion, diseases of the mouth and throat, and cancer.\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "\n\nSmall doses of Cinchona bark extract has astringent, tonic and bitter properties. At high doses, the extracts produce antimalarial and antipyretic action. Quinine is cytotoxic and therefore anti-protozoal, especially against the causative agent of malaria. It acts mainly on the asexual erythrocytic forms (schizonticide). At high doses, quinine causes sensory disturbances (tinnitus, vertigo, diplopia) and oxytocin release (risk of abortion). Quinidine is an antiarrhythmic compound, decreasing the excitability of the heart by reducing its permeability to potassium ion. Crude extracts and fractions from the bark of the plant is active against the 3D7 strain of chloroquine sensitive P. falciparum in vitro (IC50 <10 \u03bcg/ml), but not active on P. berghei in vivo (do Ce'u of Madureira et al., 2002). The plant is tonic, bitter, appetizer and digestive stimulant. One of the polysaccharides from the bark is cytotoxic. At high doses, it causes thrombocytopenia (J\u00e4ger et al. 2007; Buddenhagen et al., 2004). The dichloromethane/methanol (1:1) extract showed a cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cells (Kaileh et al., 2007). The bark decoction is administered orally as an antipyretic and as appetite stimulant in the treatment of malaria (Hanlidou et al., 2004). The leaves are used against fever, headaches and respiratory infections (Kaileh et al., 2007).\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nClinical studies have shown that effective dose of natural quinine bark extract elicited the same antimalarial activity as an effective dose of the synthesized quinine drug. A recent use for quinine drugs has been for the treatment of muscle spasms and leg cramps. A 1998 study documented the beneficial effects of natural quinine bark for leg cramps, with tinnitus being the only documented side effect. In 2002, a double-blind placebo study was undertaken in which 98 people with nocturnal leg cramps were given 400 mg of quinine daily for 2 weeks. The results stated that quinine administered at this dose effectively reduced the frequency, intensity, and pain of leg cramps without relevant sideeffects (http://www.rain-tree.com).\n\n\n\n",

In Zaire and the Casamance district of Senegal, infusions of the roots are used in the treatment of stomach and intestinal disorders (Silva et al., 1996; Kerharo and Adam, 1974). In Ghana, dried root decoctions of the herb, prepared by boiling the powdered root in water, are used in treating various forms of fever, malaria, urinary and upper respiratory tract infections, rheumatism and venereal diseases. An aqueous decoction of the root bark is used in Congolese traditional medicine for the treatment of amoebiasis (Boye, 1989).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Scientific investigations have demonstrated a wide range of phytopharmacological actions of C. sanguinolenta, consistent with its traditional usage. The root has been variously used as an antimalarial, antihypertensive, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial and antihyperglycaemic agent. C. sanguinolenta has shown activity against Campylobacter infection and V. cholera (Sawer, 1995). Extracts of the plant have been found to be effective against Entamoeba histolytica in vitro (Tona et al., 1998). Cryptolepine showed stronger activity than the antibiotics, co-trimazole and sulphamethoxazole but just as effective as ampicillin (Paulo et al., 1994b). The compound has also shown significant antihypertensive and antipyretic effects in dogs (Raymond-Hamet, 1938). The plant has demonstrated antimicrobial (schistosomes) and antifungal activity (Iwu, 1993). Aqueous extracts have been shown to be less effective than the ethanolic extracts in some of the anti-malarial and antibacterial studies (Cimanga et al., 1997; Boye, 1989). An aqueous ethanolic root bark extract showed potent antibacterial, anticomplement and moderate antiviral activities but no antifungal effect could be detected (Cimanga et al., 1996). Other studies have shown C. sanguinolenta extracts to have in vitro antiinflammatory and antihyperglycaemic effects (Bierer, et al., 1998; Bamgbose and Noamesi, 1981). The root infusions are used in Zaire and Senegal in the treatment of stomach and intestinal disorders (Sofowora, 1982; Kerharo and Adam, 1974). An aqueous decoction of the root bark is used in Congo for the treatment of amoebiasis (Tona, et al., 1998).\n\n\n\n",

        "Safety data": "\n\nIn animal studies using rats, the LD50 was >3000 mg/kg and treatment did not cause changes in body weight or organ/body \u2013 weight ratios. The aqueous extract caused a dose-dependent increase in pentobarbitone sleeping time in rats in both 24-hour and 14-day subacute studies (Ansah et al., 2008). Additionally, the aqueous extract provoked a decrease in the spontaneous activity in mice using the activity cage (Ansah et al., 2008). Increased number of platelets and neutrophils was observed but there were no serious adverse effects on the liver or the kidney. Anxiogenic activity of the aqueous extract has been demonstrated in mice (Ansah et al., 2008). The aqueous extract is cytotoxic to mammalian cells in vitro. The cytotoxic activity of the major alkaloid cryptolepine is believed to be due to interaction with DNA (Bonjean et al., 1988) and binding to topoisomerase II (Bonjean et al., 1988).

        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "A cream made from the plant was effective against ringworm and clinical isolates of four dermatophytes in vitro (Wannissorn et al., 1996; Lima et al., 1993). In a two-day trial on an experimental bird\u2019s skin, ointment and cream formulations containing lemongrass oil exhibited mosquito repellent actions comparable to that of a commercial mosquito repellent (Oyedele et al., 2002). The essential oil also has antibacterial activity (Wannissorn et al., 2005). The geranial and neral components individually showed broad \u2013 spectrum antibacterial action but myrcene did not show any observable antibacterial activity on its own (Onawunmi et al., 1984). The essential oil also possessed antinociceptive action while oral and intraperitoneal administration of the oil increased the reaction time to thermal stimuli and strongly inhibited the acetic acid \u2013 induced writhings in mice. The opioid antagonist naloxone inhibited the oil\u2019s central antinociceptive action (Viana et al., 2000). Extracts of the plant have also been shown to have topical analgesic effects (Lorenzetti et al., 1991). In vivo studies have shown that the essential oil possessed anxiolytic, sedative and anticonvulsive (Blanco et al., 2007) as well as antimicrobial and antioxidant effects (Saccheti et al., 2005) and an inhibitory effect on the diethylnitrosamine \u2013 induced early phase hepatocarcinogenesis in rats (Puatanachokchai et al., 2002). Leaf extracts of C. citratus showed antidiabetic effects in vivo. A daily oral intake of 125 \u2013 500 mg/kg of aqueous fresh leaf extract of the plant reduced fasting plasma glucose and lipid parameters in normal, male Wistar rats for 42 days.

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nUsed in the treatment of fever and scorpion sting, cough, bronchial and paroxysmal asthma, amoebic dysentery, hay fever and worm infestations (NHP, 2008). In China, the plant is used to treat dysentery, athlete's foot and other skin conditions.\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Aqueous extracts of the plant strongly reduced the release of prostaglandins I2, E2 and D2. The extracts also inhibited platelet aggregation and depressed the formation of carrageenin induced rat paw oedema (Hiermann and Bucar, 1994). Aqueous and ethanolic leaf extracts exhibited a similar diuretic effect to that of acetazolamide; the extracts produced time \u2013 dependent increase in urine output (Johnson et al., 1999). The aqueous leaf extract caused a decrease in gastrointestinal motility in normal rats and reduced the effect of castor oil-induced diarrhoea in mice (Hore et al., 2006). The lyophilized decoction of the plant had antidiarrhoeic activity in castor oil, arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E2-induced diarrhoea (Galvez et al., 1993). The ethanol extracts have been found to be non-cytotoxic and effective antibacterial agents (Vijaya et al., 1995). Ethanolic extracts of the aerial parts exhibited a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, particularly against Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (Sudhakar et al., 2006). The plant has been shown to be effective in vitro and in vivo and clinically, against Entamoeba, the causative agent of amoebic dysentery (Evans, 2002). E. hirta whole plant preparation is sold in Mali for the treatment of this condition (Keita, 1994). Aqueous and serially purified latex extracts have potent molluscicidal activity (Singh et al., 2004). Orally administered doses of 100 \u2013 400 mg/kg per day of ethanol and dichloromethane extracts of the whole plant produced a significant chemosuppression of parasitaemia in mice infected with P. berghei berghei (Baslas and Agarwal, 1980) and a high antiplasmodial activity (IC50 < 3g/ml) (Tona et al., 2004). The plant possessed sedative, anxiolytic, central analgesic, antipyretic and antiphlogistic effects (Singh et al., 2004).\n\n\n\n",

The aqueous and chloroform root extracts were inactive against Plasmodium strains (Spencer et al., 1947).  The methanol extract of the leaves was active against Mycobacterium phlei (Anani et al., 2002), while the ethanol and chloroformic extracts of the root also showed activity against Mycobacterium fortuitum with MIC greater than 1 mg/ml (Balde et al., 1995). The leaf extract was found to be active against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus but inactive against E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Anani et al., 2002) and the methanolic root bark extract showed activity against Helicobacter pylori with MIC of 250 \u00b5/ml (Fabry et al., 1996). The extracts of the plant have been studied on other pests and vectors; the ethanolic stem bark extract was inactive in mice experimentally infected with Schistosoma mansoni (Balde et al., 1989) although nonpolar extracts showed high toxicity against\n\nBiomphalaria glabrata. The methanolic root-bark extract (0.03%) demonstrated activity against Candida albicans (Sawhney et al., 1978) whereas the methanolic leaf extract was inactive against the same species and other fungal strains (Anani et al., 2002). The methanolic leaf extract of a sample obtained from Togo was active against Herpes simplex (250 \u00b5/ml), Sindbis virus (500 \u00b5/ml) and poliovirus (500 g/ml) (Hudson et al., 2000).

        "Description of the plant": "\n\nA tropical, annual plant, 150\u2013210 cm tall, making a broad clump of branches from the base; originally from West Africa; lobed, reddish leaves; stems also reddish, nearly or quite glabrous. The most important edible part is the fleshy sepal or calyx, intensely red, tastes acidic, and harvested before developing into woody matter. The calyx is the part that is left over after the bloom. Leaves are ovate and undivided, stems are 7.2-9.6 cm across, leaves are 3-lobed or parted, and lobes measure 2.4 cm or more, normally broad and crenate-serrate or dendate. Flowers axillary, solitary and nearly sessile. Corolla, yellow and twice as long as its thickness. Fruits, ovoid, pubescent and 1.2-1.8 cm long (GHP, 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "Other parts used": "\n\nNone\n\n\n\n",
        "Definition of plant material of interest": "Hibiscus is the dried calyx and calyculus of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (Malvaceae).\n\n\n\n",
        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nThe dry calyx of this plant possesses great commercial value because of its use as a plant colorant for food and drugs, but principally due to its use as beverage and, recently, for its antihypertensive properties (Haji-Faradi and HajiTarkhani, 1999). The plant is a tropical beverage used commonly in folk medicines to treat hypertension, pyrexia, inflammation, liver disorders, kidney and urinary bladder stones, and obesity (Liu et al., 2006). Its leaves are commonly used as a diuretic, sedative and refrigerant, and its fruits are considered to be an anti-scorbutic. The calyces are commonly prepared as a drink and used as a mild diuretic, a colorectal, an intestinal anti-septic, a mild laxative, and as an aid in heart and nerve conditions, to lower blood pressure and to treat calcified arteries (Ajay et al., 2007; Onyenekwe et al., 1999).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "It is most probably spasmolytic and may protect against angina pectoris. It can be used to facilitate weight gain. Studies have confirmed its ethnomedical use as an antihypertensive (Carvajal-Zarrabal et al., 2005; Hansawasdi et al., 2001). The aqueous extracts of the calyx of H. sabdariffa in anaesthetized rats caused a dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial pressure (Hirupanich et al., 2006). Sectioning of the right and left vagal nerves did not have a significant effect on the fall in mean arterial pressure. Cholinergic blockade with 0.2 mg kg-1 atropine and histaminergic blockade with 1 mg kg-1 cimetidine and 15 mg kg-1 promethazine significantly attenuated the hypotensive response (Hirupanich et al., 2006). The dried flower extracts possessed antioxidant activity and protected rat hepatocytes from t-BHP-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity (Christian et al., 2006; Falade et al., 2005). A lectin, reacting with T, Tn, and Th polyagglutinable red blood cells present in an extract from the seed of the plant was found to be a useful addition to those available for distinguishing various types of red blood cell polyagglutinability. Topical application of protocatechuic acid isolated from the plant (5, 10 or 20 mmol) to mice which were initiated with benzo[\u03b1]pyrene (B[\u03b1]P), 5 minutes prior to TPA (15 nmol) treatment twice weekly, for 20 weeks, significantly inhibited the incidence of tumours, while all the mice in the TPA-treated group developed tumours. The same doses of PCA also reduced the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the mouse skin. These results indicate that PCA possesses chemo-preventive potential\n\n(Herrera-Arellano et al., 2004).\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nThe urine of 36 healthy subjects, after consumption of the flower juice, showed a decrease of creatinine, uric acid, citrate, tartrate, calcium, sodium, potassium and phosphate but not oxalate (Carvajal-Zarrabal et al., 2005). This could help the treatment and prevention of renal stones.\n\n\n\n",

        "Precautions for use": "\n\nProlonged consumption in man could produce toxic effects (Alarcon-Aguilar, 2007). Results of histopathological studies on animals showed that prolonged usage of the extract in high doses could cause liver injury while the effect was mild at small dose levels. Though the average consumption of 150\u2013180 mg/kg per day appears safe, the extracts should be taken with caution (Alarcon-Aguilar et al., 2007).\n\n\n\n",

        "Description of the plant": "\n\nThe generic name Hymenocardia is derived from the Greek words \u2018hymen\u2019 - membrane and \u2018kardia \u2019- heart, in reference to the heart-shaped fruits which have a transparent membrane (hymen). The specific name acida describes the sour taste of its fruits (Burkill, 1994). H. acida is a small savanna tree or shrub about 9 m high; branchlets become rusty brown as the bark peels; the bole is short, often flattened and usually crooked; branches form a fairly heavy, somewhat rounded crown; bark smooth or flaky, pinkish-brown when fresh but becoming pale brown or grey later; leaves thin, leathery, elliptic-oblong up to 8.75 cm long and 3.75 cm broad, usually pubescent when young with a dense mat of fine hairs and with golden glands beneath, apex obtuse to rounded, base obtuse; petiole slender, up to 1.8 cm long; flowers unisexual, male flowers reddish-yellow occurring in clusters of spikes up to 6.5 cm long; calyx cupular, red, anthers creamy white, female flowers green, placed on axils of leafy lateral branches and bearing a prominent crimson stigma spreading about 1.25 cm; fruit compressed, obcordate and reddish-brown, 2.5 cm long and 2.5-3.75 cm broad, developing in pairs along one edge, each with a thin pale brown nearly square wing; seed flattened, glossy brown.\n\n\n\n",

The decoction of the roots is used as a mouthwash against caries and bad breath (Kerharo and Adam, 1974); it is hypotensive, antipyretic and antimalarial (Bernard, 2001) and also used to treat sickle cell crises (Mpiana et al. , 2007),  stomatitis, diarrhoea, dysentery, gastric ulcers, colic and painful periods (Ukwe, 1997). When mixed with honey, the leaf decoction is used to treat digestive disorders (Ukwe, 1997). The infused mixture of bark and leaves is used against respiratory disorders, hypertension, epilepsy and insanity (Basilevskaia, 1969; Diallo, 2002).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "The plant extracts showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus.

It interferes with both classical and alternative pathways of the complement system with MICs of 13.32 and\n\n60.34 mg/ml (Balde et al., 1996). Mpiana et al., (2007) showed that the plant has significant antisickling activity. The observed diuretic effect of the aqueous extract was comparable to furosemide. The hydroalcoholic extract exhibited antioxidant properties (3038 \u00b1 66 \u00b5mol TE / g) similar to chlorogenic acid (3165 \u00b1 186 micromol TE/g) and superior to the ethanol extract of Rosemary (591 \u00b1 20 \u00b5mol TE/g) [Duval and Baldi, 2010]. The aqueous extracts possessed a vasorelaxant effect due partly to a direct action on the contractile apparatus and also by stimulation of the vascular endothelium (Duval and Balde, 2010), while the dichloromethane extract of the leafy twigs showed a significant anti-trypanosomal activity and moderate activity against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. The crude extract of the root showed significant anthelmintic activity against the intestinal parasite Haemonchus contortus.

Juss (Meliaceae).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnomedicinal uses\n\nThe bitter stem bark is used as a remedy for fever. The decoction or fresh bark macerated in cold water or the dried bark, pulverized and mixed with salt is taken in small doses every other day. The bark is used as stomachic and bitter tonic, depurative, vermifuge and taenicide to treat syphilis. The bark and crushed seeds are used as emmenagogue. Cold infusion of the bark is given to horses as a tonic to improve appetite and to cattle suffering from liver fluke. Dried pulverized bark is used as a dressing for ulcers on the backs of camels and horses (Adesogan et al., 1967; Androulakis et al., 2006).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "A limonoid from the aqueous extracts of the stem bark and leaves exhibited a strong antisickling activity (Fall et al., 1999). Local application of ointments made from the hydro-alcoholic extract of the bark on laboratory animals showed that the plant has anti-inflammatory activity. An extract of the bark also showed the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on cancer cell lines (Androulakis et al., 2006). Extracts were more potent against Culex annulirostris, hexane and ethanol were the best solvents for the extraction of the essential oils (Shaalan et al., 2006). The anthelmintic constituents of the bark extract demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo activity against gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep (Ademola et al., 2009). Koko et al. (2008) reported the in vitro immunomodulating properties of ethanolic bark and leaf extracts. Alcoholic extracts at a dose of 2 g/kg caused depression, sedation and reduced locomotor activity in mice; it also protected 70% of the mice against leptazol-induced convulsions. 3\u03b1,7\u03b1dideacetylkhivorin limonoid, isolated from the methanol extract, showed significant growth inhibitory activities against MCF-7, SiHa and Caco-2 cells with IC50 values in the range of 0.070.14 \u00b5 (Zhang et al., 2007). Oral administration of ethanolic stem bark extract (2 mg/kg) in rats, significantly increased the activities of liver alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase compared with the control. The results indicate that the ethanolic stem bark extract has the ability to induce synthesis of the liver enzymes (Yakubu et al., 2005).\n\n\n\n",

A leaf extract showed anti-tumour and tuberculostatic effects in vivo. The extract showed a broad fungitoxic spectrum of various dermatophytes, which was attributed to lawsone. Preparations of the plant showed antifertility activity. Lawsonia possesses in vitro antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of bacterial strains (such as Shigella sonnei) and against C. albicans (Habbal et al., 2005). Ethanolic extract of the plant has significant healing effects and an inhibitory activity on protein glycation (Sultana et al., 2008). Ethanolic, aqueous and methanolic leaf extracts have shown modest reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity (Suthienkul et al., 1993). The tuberculostatic activity of the plant has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (Sharma, 1990), whilst the stem bark extract has been shown to have fungistatic and fungicidal properties (Singh and Pandey, 1989; Tripathi et al., 1978). The in vitro hypoglycaemic activity of the methanol extract was demonstrated by Arayne et al., (2007) and Mikhaeil et al., (2004) showed that the extract\u2019s antioxidant properties were comparable to that of ascorbic acid. Many other properties have been attributed to the compound lawsone and constituents such as the flavonoids (luteolin, acacetine), gallic acid, carbohydrates (Aweke et al., 2005). These properties include antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic (Ali et al., 1995).\n\n\n\n",

There was no effect of the aqueous extract on renal function and the effect on liver function was considered to be mild. Contact allergy (skin) has been reported with pure henna (Polat et al., 2009). The cytotoxicity of henna and lawsone has been demonstrated (Sauriasari et al., 2007). The use of henna can have side effects such as haemolytic anemia in case of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (Kok et al., 2004).

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nLippia is a popular plant with a long history of use as an aromatic tea in African traditional medicine and other parts of the world. The leaves are used as a hot beverage and a tea-like infusion for fevers, gastrointestinal disturbances, enteritis, coughs and colds. Rural communities in some parts of W. Africa take Lippia tea after a hard day\u2019s work to relax and enhance sleep, while in urban areas the tea is drunk in the morning to relieve stress.  In Ghana and Nigeria, an infusion of the leaves is used for the treatment of malarial and microbial infections (Kerharo and Adam, 1974; Kunle et al., 2003; Ajaiyeoba et al., 2004). The tea is also used traditionally as an antihypertensive, and a laxative. A drink made from the bolied leaves and palm nut is used to expel placenta after delivery (Burkill, 1997; Irvine, 1961). In Mali the powdered leaf is used in the production of a remedy for treating malaria (Diallo et al., 2004).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Leaf extracts of the plant have considerable hypotensive effects (Pham et al., 1988). L. multiflora has demonstrable tranquilizing and analgesic properties comparable to diazepam (Abena et al., 1998). The oil has also shown muscle relaxant effect; it depresses cardiac contractility (Mwangi et al., 1992; Mwangi, 1990). The hexane and dichloromethane extracts showed antimicrobial activity with the hexane fraction possessing the higher activity, attributable to carvacrol an antimicrobial agent, isolated from it (Kunle et al., 2003). The essential oil had antibiotic activity against the mosquito larvae and it was more active than DEET as insect-repellant when tested on the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) (Mwangi et al., 1991). Lippia oil exhibited marked antifungal activity against Colletotrichum coffeanum, the causative agent of coffee berry disease (Mwangi et al.,1991; AddaeMensah, 1992). The essential oil also showed significant and dose-dependent analgesic effect on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice; only a dose of 8 ml/kg of essential oil antagonized brewer's yeast-induced hyperexia and no effect on granuloma formation was observed.\n\n\n\n",

The plant\u2019s antimalarial activity and the lack of genotoxicity have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (Monjanel-Mouterde et al., 2006). Extracts of the plant inhibited the growth of Plasmodium falciparum (Mustafa et al., 2000). The aqueous extracts produced a concentration-dependent ex vivo increase in cardiac contractile response and coronary flow but did not modify heart rate in the rat. This showed that the extract possesses positive inotropic effect resulting in an increase in coronary flow without inducing tachycardia in isolated heart (Ou\u00e9draogo et al., 2004). Sy et al., (2004) have reported the myorelaxant and antispasmodic activities of the extracts of M. inermis whose alkaloids have been reported to increase biliary flow and also decrease hepatic enzymes and total cholesterol in the rat (Tour\u00e9 et al., 1996).\n\n\n\n",

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nM. charantia is a popular medicinal plant widely used in traditional medicine in all humid and subhumid tropical countries, where they grow spontaneously. Among the Yorubas of Nigeria, the decoction is used to treat malaria and in Senegal, the leaves are indicated for fever, whilst the fruits and leaves are used against itchy skin conditions such as scabies (Paulino de Albuquerque et al., 2007). The decoction or poultice of the leaves is used to treat mouth sores, gangrenous wounds and gastric ulcers (Agyare et al., 2009), while the whole plant is used to treat malaria, stomach ache, stomach acidity, fever, diarrhoea, intestinal parasites and kidney complaints (Luziatelli et al., 2010). Fruit, tender shoots and tender roots are used for diabetes, blood purification and snake bite. Others also use the leaves to treat rabies, chest and rheumatic pains (Pradhan and Badola,\n\n2008).\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "\n\nOral intake of different doses of the fruit, juice, or powder by subjects with maturity onset diabetes mellitus significantly reduced blood glucose levels and/or improved glucose-tolerance (Welihinda et al., 1986). The fruit decoction showed hypoglycaemic activity in normal rabbits. Charantin is thought to be partly responsible for the hypoglycaemic effect. p-Insulin isolated from the seeds and fruit of the plant has also shown hypoglycaemic activity (Ng et al., 1986; Welihinda et al., 1986; Best et al., 1924). Alcoholic extract of the pulp has antidiabetic activity (Sarkar et al., 1996). A group of ribosome-inactivating proteins (\u03b1- and \u03b2momorcharin, momordin, and cucurbitacin B) have been reported to possess cytotoxic activity (GHP, 1992). The aqueous crude extract demonstrated the ability to inhibit the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which is thought to be linked to the pathogenesis and replication of psoriasis, leukaemia and cancer. This crude extract killed human leukaemia cells in a dose-dependent manner while normal human lymphocytes subjected to the same doses were not affected (GHP, 1992). The compound momordin demonstrated cytotoxic activity against Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in vivo, while several other in vivo studies have shown the cytostatic and antitumor activity of the entire plant. Aqueous extracts inhibited the growth of rat prostate carcinoma and the development of mammary tumours in mice (GHP, 1992).The proteins \u03b1- and \u03b2-momorcharin have been reported to inhibit HIV virus in vitro. Momordica Anti-human Immunovirus Protein (MAP30) has been reported to activate natural killer cells and thus interfere with replication of HIV viruses. It also increased the body's production of interferon-gamma, a natural substance that fights all types of viruses. Extracts of the plant also have antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 and antihelminthic and antiinflammatory effects (Lans et al., 2007; Beloin et al., 2005). Methanol extract has antiulcer activity (Alam et al., 2009). Leaves of M. charantia have been found to possess antibacterial effects against E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus (Georges and Pandelai, 1949), while the methanolic extract of the whole plant has anti-parasitic effects in vitro (Mesia et al., 2008). The alcoholic extract of the fruit has spermicidal activity (an ethanol extract caused a decrease in testicular weights and sperm production in gerbils and dogs), while the root has abortifacient effects in females (Jamwall and Anand, 1964). The seeds demonstrated the ability to induce abortion in rats and mice, and the fruit and leaf exhibited in vivo antifertility effect in female animals. Several components of the fruit such as charantin and sitosterol showed stimulating effects on the uterus (Yeung, 1996).\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nA four-week, randomized, double-blind trial found that the plant had a modest hypoglycaemic effect and significantly reduced blood sugar levels among patients with Type 2 diabetes, who took 2000 mg daily.

In sub-chronic toxicity studies, repeated administration of 100, 200 and 1000 mg/kg of aqueous leaf extract for 14 days caused hypoglycaemia. The red arils of the seeds are dangerous to children. Two cases of poisoning secondary to ingestion of fresh leaf infusion have been reported. They resulted in a status epilepticus and required hospitalization. The toxicity of two fruit extracts (ethanol and unripe fruit juice) was evaluated in normal and diabetic rats. Both extracts decreased blood glucose levels in two rat models. In normal rats the two extracts had no significant effect on blood levels of urea, creatinine, ALT, AST and AP, while in diabetic rats the two extracts caused a significant decrease in levels of serum urea, creatinine, ALT, AST, AP, cholesterol and triglycerides.

        "Definition of plant material of interest": "Brimstone tree consists of the leaf, root or the stem bark of Morinda lucida Benth. (Rubiaceae).\n\n\n\n",
        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nIn West Africa, M. lucida is an important plant in traditional medicine. Decoctions and infusions or poultices of roots, bark and leaves are recognized remedies for the treatment of different types of fever (including yellow fever), malaria, trypanosomiasis and bouts of fever during labour. The plant is also used in cases of diabetes, hypertension, stroke, dysentery, stomach pain, ulcers, leprosy and gonorrhoea. In Nigeria, M. lucida is one of the four most commonly used traditional remedies against fever. In Cote d\u2019Ivoire, a bark decoction is used against jaundice, and in DR Congo it is combined with the powdered root bark as a poultice to treat the itch and ringworm The fruits are used in the treatment of asthma (Chin, 2002) and in Nigeria, the leaves are used to treat diabetes (Gbolade, 2009; www.prota.org). The leaves, stem bark and roots are used in the treatment of malaria (Asase and Oppong-Mensah, 2009; Adebayo and Kretti, 2011), while the infusion or decoction of the leaves and bark of the trunk, are used in the treatment of oral cancer (Ashida et al., 2010). The decoction of the bark of the trunk is also used in the treatment of haemorrhoids and gastric ulcer (Agyare et al., 2009).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "The purgative effect of a methanol extract of the leaves of the plant has been reported. Oral treatment (12.5-100 mg/kg) caused a pronounced increase in the number of wet faeces in rats and potentiated castor oil-induced diarrhoea in mice (Olajide et al., 1999). The dried methanol extract of the leaves promoted gastric emptying in rats and intestinal motility in mice. The extract did not induce gastric ulceration nor did it afford protection against acetylsalicylic acidinduced ulcer in rats. (Olajide et al.,1998). The extract of the root bark exhibited a mutagenic activity with a low cytotoxicity (Sowemimo et al., 2007). Extracts of the leaves had significant dose-dependent in vitro inhibitory effect on the growth of Plasmodium falciparum (Do Ceu de Madureira, 2002; Tona et al., 1999). The crude extracts of the leaves and stem bark also had antiplasmodial effect with an IC50 value of 3.90 and 5,70 \u00b5g/ml respectively, whilst the compound urosilic acid, isolated from the plant, exhibited an antiplasmodial activity with IC50 value of 3.10 \u00b5g/ml (Adebayo and Kretti, 2011).  Leaf and stem bark extracts showed significant but nonselective cytotoxic properties (Ashidi et al., 2010). The anthraquinones and triterpenoid acids of the plant exhibited in vitro antileishmanial and antimalarial activites (Sittie et al., 1999).\n\n\n\n",

        "Habitat and geographical distribution": "\n\nM. oleifera is believed to be native to the subHimalayan tracts of Northern India.  However, it grows in many parts of the savanna tropics, probably spreading through intensive cultivation for various purposes.  According to Muluvi et al., (1999) the Moringa tree was introduced to Africa from India at the turn of the twentieth century. In the West African sub-region, M. oleifera appears to be more important in relatively more arid regions.  It is found in Ghana, mostly in the northern regions, in Mali, in the more arid northern parts of Nigeria and in many other places where it is known to be edible.  Moringa is naturalized in Malawi, Niger, Senegal and Tanzania. In India, the young pods or drumsticks are canned and exported all over the world. Moringa is adapted to arid sandy conditions and although drought-resistant, it is intolerant of water logging. It can grow well in the humid tropics\u2019 blistering heat, desiccating dryness or destitute soils. However, Moringa grows best on dry sandy soil and yields much less foliage when it is continuously under water stress. It can be grown as annual or greenhouse plant in temperate zones. The plant is reported to tolerate annual rainfall of 4.8 \u2013 40.3 dm, temperature range of 26 to 40oC and pH of 4.5-\n\n8.5. It grows well from sea level to an elevation of 1000 m.  In tropical and sub-tropical climates, it fruits freely and continuously. Moringa is reported to tolerate bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal attacks, although it has its own specific pathogens. Heavy pruning encourages lateral shoots and increase leaf production, keeping the plant at a height convenient for easy harvesting and providing a means of obtaining very high yields of leaf matter.\n\n\n\n",

        "Definition of plant material of interest": "\n\nMoringa consists of the fresh or dried leaf of Moringa oleifera Lam. (Moringaceae).\n\n\n\n",
        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nThe plant is cultivated for its leaves, fruits, roots and seeds for a variety of uses, both food and drug.  Almost every part of the plant is valuable as food.  However, the leaves and pods are more used as food sources or supplements.  The young leaves of M. oleifera are edible and are part of the traditional diets in many countries where the tree grows and are eaten cooked or added to food as dried leaf powder.  The seeds are eaten as peanuts and the oil from it is edible.  Thickened roots are used as substitute for horseradish.  One most notable use of Moringa leaf powder is for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition, especially in children.  The record of medicinal uses of M. oleifera in folklore is abundant.  Plant parts other than the leaves are responsible for most of the medicinal uses of the plant, especially the roots and seeds.  However, the leaves also have medicinal uses in folklore.  Flowers, leaves and roots of the plant are used for tumours.  The leaves as poultice, is applied to sores or rubbed on the temples as a treatment for headaches.  The poultice of leaves is also used in reducing glandular swellings.  The leaves are used as a purgative, to promote digestion and \tin \ttraditional \tmedicine \tas \ta hypocholesterolemic agent in obese individuals. The juice extracted from the leaves is applied directly on to the eye for the treatment of conjunctivitis. It is also warmed and applied to affected areas to relieve the pain associated with sprain.  The leaves are used in a preparation which is cooked and taken for the treatment of high blood pressure. In India, the plant is used as an abortifacient (Nath et al., 1992).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "The plant\u2019s isothiocyanate glycoside, and the thiocarbamates niaziminin A and niaziminin B were shown to have hypotensive activity but not the nitrile glycosides niazirin and niazirinin (Faizi et al., 1994). M. oleifera is one of the few plants known to contain all the three types of compounds, nitriles, thiocarbamates and isothiocyanates (Faizi et al., 1994), which can be transformed to thiocyanates in mammalian metabolism.  Pterygospermin isolated from the flowers and seeds is bacteriocidal and fungicidal and the alkaloids moringinine, acts as a cardiac stimulant and produces a rise in blood pressure. The compound 4-[(4\u2019-O-acetyl-\u03b1-Lrhamnosyloxy)benzyl] isothiocyanate, a glucosinolate has been shown to have antibiotic activity, whilst the thiocarbamate and isothiocyanate compounds inhibit tumourpromoter teleocidin B-4-induced Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) activation in Raji cells (Murakami et al., 1998). The juice from the leaves and stem bark inhibited Staphylococcus aureus but not Escherichia coli. A 50% ethanolic extract of the aerial part of M. oleifera showed anti-cancer activity against human epidermoid carcinoma of nasopharynx in tissue culture and P388 lymphocytic leukemia in mice. Crude extract of M. oleifera has been shown to have cholesterol lowering effect.  Ghasi et al., (2000) showed that administration of a crude leaf extract along with a high-fat diet decreased the high-fat diet-induced increases in the levels of cholesterol in the serum, liver and kidney in rats.  An ethanolic extract of M. oleifera has been shown to contain a plant growth promoting hormone of the cytokinin type. M. oleifera leaf extract may be used to regulate hyperthyroidism since it has been shown to inhibit the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to tri-iodotyronin (T3) in female rats (Tahiliani and Kar, 2000). However, the effect was absent in male rats.The leaf extract has also been shown to be abortifacient.  In a study to evaluate the anti-reproductive potential of the plant, leaf extract of M. oleifera was shown to be 100% abortifacient at a dose equivalent to 175 mg/Kg of starting dry material (Nath et al., 1992). Various studies have demonstrated the nutritional value of Moringa leaves.  In a survey of some wild plants of importance used during drought, Lockett et al., (2000) found Moringa to be a good source of protein and fat and an excellent source of calcium, iron, copper and zinc. The leaves contain high amounts of provitamin A in the form of carotenoids, especially \u03b2carotene, and high amounts of Vitamin C when raw. The amino acid composition of the proteins compares favourably with the World Health Organization standards for essential amino acids (Freiberger et al., 1998).  All the essential amino acids are at a higher than adequate concentrations when compared with the recommended FAO/WHO/UNO reference standars for 2 to 5 year old children.  The leaves are a good source of the sulphur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine, which are often low in plant proteins. In a study of mineral composition of non-conventional leafy vegetables including M. oleifera, all the vegetables studied contained high levels of calcium compared to common vegetables.\n\nMicro-nutrients varied among the vegetables but M. oleifera had the highest content of zinc, although the mean daily intake of the various micro-nutrients were lower than the recommended daily allowances (RDAs), except for magnesium (Barminas et al, 1998).  The leaves of the plant also contain significant amounts of selenium and phosphorus\n\n(Freiberger et al., 1998).  However, the mineral content of the leaves may vary depending on the geographical location of the plant.  The iron content is good enough for the leaves to be prescribed for anaemia in the Philippines. Vitamin A, in the form of \u03b2-carotene, is the most abundant vitamin in M. oleifera with values as high as 22,000 IU per 100 g of leaf (Echo\u2019s Knowledge Bank) compared to the average reported value of approximately 11,000.  Bioavailability trials indicate that \u03b2-carotene from M. oleifera can overcome Vitamin A deficiency. Using a rat model, Nambiar and Seshadri (2001) found that with respect to growth parameters, fresh leaves of M. oleifera, as well as the leaf powder, were better than synthetic vitamin A, although serum levels of the vitamin were higher with the group of animals on synthetic vitamin A. According to one report, the B Vitamins are not particularly high in M. oleifera.  However, the physiological availability of thiamine, riboflavin and niacin, calculated from individual doseresponse curves, is high (Girija et al.,, 1982). Vitamin E is present in M. oleifera but not in large quantities (Ching and Mohamed, 2001). Some anti-nutritional factors are present in M. oleifera and they include the sugars raffinose and stachyose, nitrate, oxalate, saponins and phytate.  The oxalates and nitrates would decrease bio-availability of minerals. As indicated by Pankaja and Prakash (1994), the presence of oxalates inhibited the intestinal absorption of calcium from M. oleifera.  Saponins are present, but unlike their counterparts in other plants, the saponins in M. oleifera do not show haemolytic properties. Intravenous administration (1-10 mg/kg) of any of the compounds (niazinine A, B niazinine, niazimicine and niaziminine A + B) produced hypotensive and bradycardic effects in anaesthetised Wistar rats. Pretreatment of animals with atropine (1 mg/kg) completely abolished the hypotensive and bradycardic effects of acetylcholine (ACh), while the cardiovascular responses of isolated compounds were unchanged, eliminating the possible involvement of muscarinic receptor activation. All compounds (50-150 pg / mL) produced negative inotropic and chronotropic effects on isolated guinea pig atria. Spontaneous contractions of rat uterus were also inhibited by all compounds (Gilani et al, 1992; 1994). The antispasmodic activity could be attributed to the presence of 4- [\u03b1-(L-rhamnosyloxy) benzyl]-o-methyl thiocarbamate in the ethanolic leaf extracts of the plant (Gilani et al., 1992).  Methanolic leaf extracts showed antiulcerogenic and hepatoprotective effects in rats; the aqueous leaf extracts also showed anti-ulcer effects. A study by Jaiswal et al., (2009) showed that aqueous leaf extracts possessed antidiabetic and hypoglycaemic properties. A significant reduction in glycosuria and proteinuria was also observed. A Japanese study of 2007 shows that consumption of Moringa improves diabetes in vivo (Hurtel, 2008) and a similar study in Thailand in the same year showed that Moringa contains antioxidants that cause a decrease in blood cholesterol levels accompanied by a significant decrease in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques (Hurtel, 2008).\n\n\n\nClinal data\n\nIn a pediatric unit of a hospital in Senegal, the reported cases of infant malnutrition recorded fell from nearly 600 in 1997 to less than 50 in the year 2000.\n\n\n\n",

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nSweet basil has been used for thousands of years as a culinary and medicinal herb. It acts principally on the digestive and nervous systems, easing flatulence, stomach cramps, colic and indigestion. The leaves and flowering tops are antispasmodic, aromatic, carminative, digestive, galactogogue, stomachic and tonic (Singh et al., 2011). It is taken internally in the treatment of feverish illnesses (especially colds and influenza), poor digestion, nausea, and abdominal cramps, gastro-enteritis, migraine, insomnia, depression and exhaustion. It is externally used to treat acne, loss of smell, insect stings, snake bites and skin infections. The leaves can be harvested throughout the growing season and are used fresh or dried (Njorege, 2006). The mucilaginous seed is taken as an infusion in the treatment of gonorrhoea, dysentery and chronic diarrhoea, and it is claimed to remove film and opacity from the eyes. The root is used in the treatment of bowel complaints in children. Extracts from the plant are bactericidal and anti-parasitic.  In India, sweet basil is used for dental ailments due to its proposed antimicrobial effects (Patel and venkatakrishna, 1988). The essential oil is used in aromatherapy.\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "In a laboratory study, O. basilicum showed promising antibacterial activity against Salmonella spp., Escherichai coli, Campylobacter jejunii, and Clostridium perferingens (Wannissorn et al., 2005). The essential oil obtained from the aerial parts was also effective against multidrug resistant clinical isolates from the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas (Opalchenova et al., 2003). A study by Niture et al., (2006) showed that O. basilicum has anti-cancer potential. Extracts from the plant caused an increase in O-6-methylguanine-DNAmethyltransferase (MGMT) levels as well as an increase in glutathione S-transferase-pi expression, albeit to a lesser extent than MGMT. Sweet basil oil has been reported to be 12.7 times less potent than the anticancer agent fluorouracil in cancer (P388) cell lines (Manasroi et al., 2006). O. basilicum showed significant inhibitory effects against HIV-1 induced cytopathogenicity in MT-4 cells (Yamasaki et al., 1998). The active components in the extract samples were found to be the water-soluble polar substances. In addition, these aqueous extracts inhibited giant cell formation in coculture of Molt-4 cells with and without HIV-1 infection and showed inhibitory activity against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. In a second laboratory study, Chiang et al., (2005) found that crude aqueous and ethanolic extracts of O. basilicum and components such as apigenin, linalool, and ursolic acid exhibit a broad spectrum antiviral activity in vitro. However, no activity was noted for carvone, cineole, \u00dfcaryophyllene, farnesol, fenchone, geraniol, \u00dfmyrcene, or \u03b1-thujone. Rosmarinic acid present in the plant inhibited complement \u2013 dependent inflammatory processes (Renzuli et al., 2004) and was also able to reduce radical oxygen species production, protein and DNA synthesis inhibition, and apoptosis in vitro. The mosquitorepellent effect of the plant has also been reported (Erler et al., 2006). Based on a study of human spermatozoa in vitro, sweet basil is thought to possess potent spermicidal action (Buch et al., 1988).\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nIn a study of patients with chronic bronchitis, exposure to essential oils of basil caused lowering of plasma levels of dienic conjugates and ketones and activation of catalase in red cells characteristic of antioxidant effects (Siurin, 1997).

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nO. gratissimum is renowned in African traditional medicine for its use in the treatment of upper respiratory tract (e.g. coughs, pneumonia, etc.) and digestive disorders (e.g. diarrhoea, dysentery), skin diseases, fever, headaches and conjunctivitis (Onajobi, 1986; Oliver-Bever, 1960). It is used as an anticonvulsant and antibacterial agent in the treatment of malaria and small pox (Irvine, 1961). The leaves are used to treat nose bleeding and dizziness, and it is chewed with salt or boiled with it and used as febrifuge and diaphoretic. Fluid obtained by rubbing the leaf with a little water is used as an eye drop for ophthalmic conditions such as conjunctivitis. The leaf infusion is mixed with pepper to treat dysentery (Dalziel, 1936). Oil from the leaves is used to prevent mosquito bites and repel other insects. The leaves are also used to treat constipation, menorrhagia and abdominal colic. The whole plant is used for rheumatism and the root for snakebite\n\n(Adjanohoun et al., 1991).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Nakamura et al., (1999) have shown that the plant\u2019s essential oil and purified extracts have antibacterial activity in vitro; the antimicrobial effect has been ascribed to the monoterpenoids eugenol and thymol contained in the volatile oils (Oliver-Bever, 1960; Sainsbury and Sofowora, 1971). The essential oil exhibited significant antimicrobial activity aginst Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella flexineri, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp and Proteus mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner (Nakamura et al., 1999). The compound responsible for the antimicrobial activity was identified as eugenol (Nakamura et al., 1999). In a related study, Ndounga and Ouamba (1997) found that the volatile oil of O. gratissimum had higher activity than the volatile oil of Ocimum bacilicum and was more potent than the reference antimicrobial agents (tetracycline, oxacillin, clotrimazole, cefotaxime, mecillinam, clinamycine, clotrimazole, ketoconazole and Nystatin) against Staph. aureus, Strept. faecalis, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Candida albicans. The oil inhibited 80% of the dermatophite strains tested (Lima et al., 1993) and also showed activity against Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Remarkable antibacterial effects, higher than those of commercial antiseptic products used as positive control were demonstrated at 2%. Leaf extracts have demonstrated promising anti-viral\n\n(anti-HIV-1) effects (Ayisi and Nyadedzor, 2003). O. gratissimum extracts have also shown promising antihelminthic effects by the ability to inhibit glutathione S-transferases from parasitic nematodes (Fakae et al., 2000). The essential oil reversibly and concentration-dependently showed relaxant effects on intestinal smooth muscle (Madeira et al., 2002). The methanolic leaf extracts demonstrated significant hypoglycaemic effect in vivo (Aguiy et al., 2000) while the aqueous and methanolic leaf extracts promoted blood coagulation (Edemeka and Ogwu, 2000). Ocimum oil was more effective in hydrophilic bases than in lipophilic bases in some ointments (Orafidiya et al., 2001).  An aqueous and butanol fractions of the crude extract of the leaf produced blood anticoagulation at 10-12mg/ml (Elujoba et al., 2001).  Investigation of the decoction of the leaf against multi drug-resistant Shigella species, isolated from patients with bacillary dysentery, inhibited isolates at 3000 mg/ml (Iwalokun et al., 2001; Ilori et al., 1996).\n\n\n\n",

It is also used for hepatitis, colds, flu, fever, tuberculosis, malaria, diabetes, hypertension and liver diseases among others. In the Asian, Mediterranean regions and most parts of east Africa, the plant is boiled and taken as tea. Hot water extract of dried aerial parts administered orally is used as a diuretic, antipyretic and antimalarial (Weninger et al., 1986; Kitisin, 1952). The hot water extract of fresh entire plant is also administered orally for gonorrhoea and other genitourinary disorders (Sahu, 1984; Khan et al., 1978). A decoction of the dried plant is used for coughs in infants and the fresh root is a remedy for jaundice. Water extract of the leaves and roots is taken orally for diabetes, and as a diuretic. Infusion of young shoots is given in dysentery, whilst the leaves are commonly used to treat fever. It can also be used to increase appetite, relieve inflammations and as a remedy for anorexia (Asprey and Thornton, 1955). In India, the fruit is used externally for tubercular ulcers, scabies and ringworm. Hot water extract of the dried plant is administered orally for diabetes and asthma in Ayurvedic medicine (Sircar, 1984; Chauhan et al., 1977; Jain and Sharma, 1967). In the Fiji Islands, the dried powdered whole plant mixed with buttermilk is administered orally for jaundice. Fresh leaf juice is used externally for cuts and bruises, but for eye diseases, the juice is mixed with castor oil and applied to the eye. Infusion of the green root is taken orally to treat heavy menstrual periods (Singh, 1986).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Phyllanthus niruri has undergone extensive phytochemical research spanning over four decades. Human and animal studies using a simple tea infusion showed the plant\u2019s ability to promote kidney stone elimination (Santos, 1990). An extract exhibited potent inhibitory effect on calcium oxalate formation in vitro (Campos et al., 1999); it also inhibited the growth of the matrix calculus in bladders of rats seeded with calcium and reduced stone satellites compared to controls (Freitas et al., 2002). The plant has also been reported to stimulate bile acid secretion and to help lower blood cholesterol levels (Khanna, et al., 2002). Hydroalcoholic extract of the plant exhibited analgesic effects in mice (Santos, et al., 1995) and in other newly-tested neurogenic pain models (Santos et al., 2000). Geraniin contained in the plant is seven times more potent as an analgesic than aspirin or acetaminophen (Miguel et al., 1996); it has demonstrated antiulcerogenic and gastroprotective effects (Hung et al., 1995). Alkamide-containing fractions of P. fraternus extract exhibited moderate antiplasmodial activity in vitro (Sittie et al., 1998) while the methanol fraction was found to have hepatoprotective properties (Ahmed et al., 2002). Two other in vivo studies have also reported the hypoglycaemic activity of the plant (Hukeri et al., 1986; Ramakishnan et al., 1982). Aqueous extract of P. niruri increased the lifespan of mice with liver cancer (Rajeshkumar et al., 2000) and exhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibition activity (Ogata et al., 1992).\n\n\n\n",

        "Habitat and geographical distribution": "P. dodecandra is native to Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar and has been introduced in Asia and tropical America. It occurs in forest, forest margins, riparian forest, thickets, wetter bushland, in fences along cultivated land and around houses, on mountain slopes and in open fields, at 1500\u20133000 m altitude. It grows best under direct sunlight in humid, weakly acidic soils that contain high levels of organic matter, in areas with an annual rainfall of about 1400 mm and a distinct dry period. In areas with high evapotranspiration, especially at lower elevations (below 1500 m) partial shade should be available so that the plants do not burn and wilt. Full shade substantially lowers both fruit yield and saponin concentration.\n\n\n\n",

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nPhytolacca dodecandra (Endod) is indigenous to Ethopia, Central and East Africa. In Ethiopia, where it is known as traditional soap, the toxic plant berries are commonly used for washing and ridding clothes of lice and to control or poison fresh water snails (Pankhurst, 1965).  It is also used for purging intestinal parasites, for abortion, and against dandruff, gonorrhoea, leeches, intestinal worms, anthrax, rabies, ringworm, skin itching and other skin diseases (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962, Esser et al., 2003). In Central and East Africa and Madagascar, an extract of the roots, leaves, fruits and seeds is taken as a purgative, laxative, diuretic or emetic. These plant parts are used to treat a wide range of diseases including worm infestations, oedema, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, wounds, scabies, eczema, psoriasis, leprosy, boils and vitiligo. An infusion of the fruit or the root decoction is widely taken to treat venereal diseases, bilharzia, rabies, malaria, sore throat and other respiratory problems, rheumatic pain and jaundice. In Ethiopia and Zimbabwe unripe fruits rich in molluscicidal saponins, are widely applied to control bilharzia-transmitting snails. The leaf sap is cicatrizing and haemostatic and causes a burning sensation on the skin. An infusion of the fruit or roots is taken orally and the young leaves and shoots are chewed to induce abortion. In East Africa ground leaves are applied to tumours; the root decoction is also drunk to cause vomiting as treatment of enlarged glands. In Tanzania macerated leaves or root bark are used to treat epilepsy while in Madagascar, a decoction of the aerial parts is applied to treat haemorrhoids.  In eastern and southern Africa the whole plant is considered poisonous, and it is said to have caused accidental death of people eating the leaves as a vegetable. The plant is usually not used as firewood, as the smoke is believed to reduce male sexual ability.\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "\n\nKloos and McCullough (1984) reported that over\n\n1000 plants have been screened for molluscicidal activities and immature berries of P. dodecandra have been found to be the most potent molluscicide. Control of Schistosoma mansoni by the soapberry endod in Ethiopia indicated that the reduction achieved in the prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis after an intervention period of four years was limited. Endod has been used in the control of Biomphalaria pfeifferi population and schistosomiasis transmission in Ethiopia (Abebe et al., 2005). The antifungal potential of the plant against 33 medically important strains of yeast and dermatophytes were investigated by Woldeamanuel et al., (2005).The MIC of the aqueous extract ranged from 19.5-312.5 mg/L. No activity was observed against yeasts, but larvicidal activity on stream flora and fauna was noted in a comparative toxicity study involving endod and other compounds. Mosquito larvae are particularly susceptible to the lethal effect of endod with confirmed susceptibility of larvae of the black fly (Simulium spp.), which causes onchocerciasis, and larvae of the domestic house fly, Musca domestica. It is thought that snail and malaria-transmitting mosquitoes may breed in the same type of environment, hence control of snails with endod may have the added benefit \tof \treducing \tmosquito \tpopulations. Schistosome cercariae and other trematode larvae are highly susceptible to endod (Spielman and \tLemma, \t1973; \tFlemings, \t1975). Karunamoorthi \tet \tal., \t(2008) \thave \talso demonstrated the toxic potential of crude extract of P. dodecandra berries against aquatic macro invertebrates \tBaetidae \t(Mayflies) \tand Hydropsychidae (Caddisflies). Endod has been shown in laboratory studies to cause strong uterine contractions (Stolzenberg et al., 1976), consistent with its use as an abortifacient in traditional societies in Ethiopia and other parts of East Africa. Intrauterine injection of small quantities of endod extract in pregnant mice caused sterile and apparently harmless abortion. In addition to preventing pregnancy, it may be useful as a \u201cday after\u201d pill (Stolzenberg and Parkhurst, 1974).\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nThe butanol extract of endod has been shown to be an extremely effective biological agent against human sperm, which explains its use as a locally produced, vaginal foam birth control agent (Parkhurst and Stolzenberg, 1975).\n\n\n\n",
        "Chemical constituents": "\n\nSaponins (triterpenoid glycosides; the aglycones of the glycosides are mainly composed of oleanolic acid, bayogenin , hederogenin and 2hydroxyoleanolic \tacid); \tphytosterols; \tlipids (palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid); sugars, starches, pectins and gums (Parkhurst et al., 1973; Lemma et al., 1972).\n\n\n\nTests for identity and purity\n\nMoisture content: not more than 12.30%\n\nTotal ash: 16.40%\n\nWater-soluble extractive: not less than 18.90% Alcohol-soluble (70%) extractive: not less than 16.20%.\n\n\n\n",

        "Safety data": "\n\nAs with other molluscicides (Lemma and Yau, 1975), small fish and tadpoles are affected by P. dodecandra at molluscicidal concentrations. Birds known to feed on berries of wild plants seem unaffected, as do waterbugs in treated streams. Preliminary studies on the toxicity of P. dodecandra to a variety of animal and plant species and tests for carcinogenic properties have been undertaken (Lemma, 1970; Lemma and Ames, 1975). Sheep force-fed with the water extract at a dose of 1 g/kg body weight died within 96 hours, whereas a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight had no apparent effect on kidney and liver function tests done over a period of 4 days. Oral administration to dogs at a dose of about 100 to 200 mg/kg body weight caused vomiting within minutes. Intravenous injection at the dose of about 50 mg/kg body weight was lethal in less than 24 hours, but 8 mg/ml of blood did not show any significant changes. The acute toxicity of two molluscicides extracted from P. dodecandra and Niclosamide, was determined. Endod-S showed a 24-h LC50 of 2.57 and 5.37 mg/L for Biomphalaria glabrata (albino) and Biomphalaria pfeifferi respectively. Niclosamide produced a 24-h LC50 of 0.063 mg/L and 0.049 mg/L for Biomphalaria glabrata (albino) and Biomphalaria pfeifferi, respectively. The 4-h LC50 for Schistosoma mansoni cercaria was 2.92 mg/L for Endod-S and 0.0008 mg/L for\n\nNiclosamide. The 24-h LC50 for Tilapia nilotica was 1.82 mg/L for Endod-S and 0.21 mg/L for Niclosamide. The acute toxicity to rats and mice was assessed by giving 0, 1000 and 2500 mg/kg of body weight of endod in distilled water at 50 mg/ml and 250 mg/ml concentrations by gavage, after which the animals were monitored for 3 days. The LD50 values were determined in rats and mice of both sexes. In rats the LD50 were 1000 mg/kg for males and 920 mg/kg for females, whereas in mice the LD50 was 1600 mg/kg for males and 3280 mg/kg for females.\n\n\n\n",

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nIn traditional African medicine, the decoction of the leaves or roots is administered orally to treat mental illness (Iwu, 1993; Costa-Campos et al., 2004). The macerated leaf is used for the treatment of hypertension and fever, and the decoction is used against gonorrhoea, rheumatism, stunted growth, liver diseases, chronic skin diseases and skin parasites (Mesia et al., 2008). A root decoction is used to treat haemorrhoids (Agyare et al., 2009).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "The total alkaloids of R. vomitoria as well as the single alkaloids have a sympatholytic action and are therefore used in treating hypertension (Oliver-Bever, 1960). Reserpine and rescinnamine are thought to be the main compounds responsible for the plant\u2019s hypotensive, CNS depressant, sedative, vasodilator\u00fd and antihepatotoxic actions. Reserpine has a sedative and tranqullising effect, but it is not hypnotic and it is thought to act through the central nervous system. La Barre (1973) has suggested that reserpine may probably be an antimetabolite of serotonin and catecholamines as it causes serotonin depletion at nerve endings. It is used as a hypotensive agent like rescinnamine and reserpiline in arterial hypertension and as a tranquilliser for the management of anxiety and psychoses (OliverBever, 1986; La Barre, 1973), while ajmaline has coronary and peripheral vasodilatory action and is therefore used in treating angina and Raynaud\u2019s disease (Fattorusso and Riter, 1967). Low doses of aqueous root bark extract caused tachypnoea, whilst high doses resulted in increasing bradypnoea and death from respiratory and cardiac arrest. A reserpine-free alkaloid preparation of the root bark had strong hypotensive effect in cats and rats (Oliver-Bever, 1960). Ethanolic root bark extract exhibited significant antiplasmodial activity with an IC50 of 2.5 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcg/ml on stem cell chloroquine-resistant\n\nPlasmodium falciparum in vitro (Zihiri et al., 2005). R. vomitoria significantly reduced lipid accumulation in experimental diabetic rats by up to 30%, (Campbell et al., 2006); aqueous and ethanolic root extracts are effective against several sensitive and resistant strains of bacteria with percentage inhibition ranging from 16 to 100 (Pesewu et al., 2008).\n\n\n\n",

An infusion of the bark has been widely used as a tonic and febrifuge, hence the description \u201cAfrican quinine\u201d (Oliver-Bever, 1986). The pulverized root and bark have been used to treat sores and gonorrhoea in Sudan, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Nigeria (Irvine, 1961). Similarly, a decoction of the root bark is commonly employed in the treatment of stomach disorders, cough and malaria fever (Irvine, 1961).

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nSclerocarya birrea leaves are used to treat jaundice and the bark is combined with the leaves of Cymbopogon gigentus to treat ascites. The plant is effective in the treatment of measles. A drink made from leaves is used for the treatment of gonorrhoea and roots and bark are used as laxatives. Maceration of the stem bark is used in the treatment of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, syphilis, dysentery, rheumatism and has a prophylactic effect against malaria. The stem bark in combination with Momordica balsamina is indicated for snake bite or scorpion stings. The bark is an effective remedy for treating haemorrhoids. Pellets made from the bark are used for neuralgia in dental caries (Adjanohoun et al., 1980). In Ghana, the leaves are used to treat snakebite, and pruritus (filarial); the stem bark, the root and the fruits are used to treat pharyngitis, splenomegaly and goitre, respectively (Mshana et al., 2000). Externally, the paste of the bark is added to shear butter and applied to the forehead to treat migraine and blepharitis. The fruit juice is effective in the treatment of ear infections, constipation, hypertension, anorexia, and scurvy. The seeds are recommended by some therapists for asthenia (Kerharo and Adams, 1974).\n\n\n\n",

According to Gueye, (1973), oral and intraperitoneal administarion of the aqueous extract of the leaves has an effect on blood glucose levels and a peripheral action on glucose uptake in rats. The ethanolic stem bark extract reduces blood pressure and has a protective effect on the kidneys and the heart in diabetes mellitus (Gondwe et al., 2008). The methanol and aqueous extracts of the stem bark administered orally at a dose of 500 mg/kg showed promising antiinflammatory action on rat paw oedema (Ojewole, 2002) and a dose of 300 mg/kg methanolic stem bark extract showed maximum inhibition in both acute and chronic inflammation in rats (Fotio et al., 2009).

Aqueous, ethanolic and chloroformic extracts have significant antagonistic effect on caffeine-induced calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum\n\n(Belemtougri et al. 2001). The antidiarrhoeal activity of the tannins and procyanidins of the lyophilized stem bark decoction has been demonstrated (Galvez et al., 1991). The acetone extract of the stem bark and leaves demonstrated antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Green et al., 2010; Eloff, 2001).

        "Other parts used": "\n\nTwig, bark, root\n\n\n\n",
        "Definition of plant material of interest": "\n\nSweet broom consists of the fresh or dried leaf of Scoparia dulcis L. (Scrophularaceae)\n\n\n\n",
        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nScroparia dulcis is used to treat diabetes, hypertension, abdominal disorders, pain, fever, inflammation, bronchitis, haemorrhoids and hepatosis (Hayashi, 2000; Satyanarayana 1969;\n\n\n\n\n\nFreire et al., 1993; Hayashi et al., 1993; Chow et al., 1974). The plant is used against burns, herpes, pimples, dysentery and hair loss\n\n(Luziatelli et al., 2010). Leaves of S. dulcis are used for dermatological (Rodrigues, 2006) and prostate disorders (Lans, 2007b). The whole plant is used in magico-religious rituals (Paulino de Albuquerque et al., 2007).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "S. dulcis has antiviral, diuretic, anti-tumour, antiulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that scopadulcic acid B and C have the ability to inhibit cell proliferation, replication of Herpes simplex 1, gastric acid secretion and PTH-stimulated bone resorption. Several studies involving isolated compounds obtained from the plant exhibited anti-tumour potential (Ahsan et al., 2003; Fulda et al., 2000; Nishino et al., 1993). A methanol extract of the leaves showed anti-cancer effects (Nishino et al., 1993). Whilst scopadulcic acid B promotes antitumour activities, scopadulcic C potentiates antiviral effects and scoparic acid A inhibits \u03b1-glucuronidase (Hayashi, 2000; Hayashi et al., 1992; Hayashi et al., 1988). Scoparinol demonstrated analgesic, antiinflammatory, diuretic and barbiturate potentiation activities in vivo (Ahmed et al., 2001). Freire et al., (1991; 1993; 1996) reported the analgesic, antiinflammatory and sympathomimetic properties of the plant. Scopaducilic acid B, scopadulciol and diacetyl scopadol (Hayashi et al., 1987) exhibited a gastroprotective effect by reversibly inhibiting the activity of H+/K+-ATPase (Asano et al., 1990; Hayashi et al., 1990b; Hayashi et al., 1991a; Mes\u00eda-Vela et al., 2007). Aqueous extracts of the plant showed antidiabetic effects in rats (Pari et al., 2005; Latha et al., 2004; Pari and Venkateswaran, 2002) and antioxidant activity in vitro (Ratnasooriya et al., 2005). Other studies have also shown the in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial (fungi and bacteria) properties of the plant (Pari et al., 2004; Garcia et al., 2010). The chloroform/methanol fractions of the plant exhibited antimicrobial activity against several human pathogenic bacteria and fungi strains (e.g. Salmonella typhii, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger) [Latha et al., 2006; Lans, 2007a]. Leaves have antiplasmodial activity (Ruiz et al., 2011). The freeze-dried aqueous extract from the aerial parts of the plant inhibited the histamine- or bethanechol-stimulated gastric secretion in mice with similar potency and the bioactivity-guided purification of the extract yielded a flavonoid-rich fraction with a specific activity 4\u20138 times higher than the aqueous extract (Mes\u00e9\u0131a-Vela et al., 2007; Igoli et al., 2005).\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nOral administration of a daily dose of 15-20 mg to diabetic patients, produced a reduction of glucosuria and hyperglycaemia, promoted wound healing and influenced the increase of haematopoeitic activity (Nath et al., 1945 in:\n\nDokosi, 1998).\n\n\n\n",

        "Safety data": "\n\nAnimal studies (100-3000 mg/kg) in rats showed that the LD50 of the aqueous extract of the leaves of Scoporia dulcis (p.o) was beyond 3000 mg/kg and there was no manifestation of clinical signs of toxicity over the period of the acute toxicity study. There was no change   in organ/bodyweight ratios or haematological parameters at the dosage range tested during the 14-day subacute study. Administration of the aqueous extract to rats (doses >100 mg/kg) resulted in increased levels of liver transaminases (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP) and indirect bilirubin. Markers for renal function did not change. These findings suggest possible damage to the hepatobiliary system.\n\n\n\n",

        "Other parts used": "\n\nStem bark\n\n\n\n",
        "Definition of plant material of interest": "Violet tree consists of the root bark or leaf of S. longepedunculata Fres. (Polygalaceae).\n\n\n\n",
        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nThe fresh root is reduced to a pulp and rubbed vigorously on a snake bite. Decoction of the root pulp or leaves in combination with other plants is used to induce emesis and purgation after poisoning (Kerharo and Adam, 1974). The decoction of the crushed leaves is applied to sores and boils to drain pus. The foam obtained from the root is mixed with water to treat gonorrhoea, while fresh root decoction is used to treat bronchitis, stomach pain and leprosy. Root and stem bark infusions are recommended as an antidote for poisoning; a powder made from the root is used as a snuff for headaches. In Ethiopia, smoke from the root is inhaled as a medicinal incense to treat flatulence. The powdered bark is used to treat wounds and a paste of pounded bark with copper sulfate is applied to blisters caused by Guinea worm to promote expulsion and for rheumatoid arthritis, chronic rheumatism, bruises or swelling, a paste of powdered root bark is used. In West Africa, the plant is used for the treatment of infantile convulsions and combined with Boophane disticha for psychoactive purposes. The plant is known in many African countries as an abortifacient (Oliver-Bever, 1986).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "The plant\u2019s antivenom and anti-inflammatory properties have been demonstrated in several scientific investigations (Kon\u00e9, 1989; Coulibaly Nee Diop, 1986; Metou, et al., 1989). The chloroform extract of the root showed antibacterial activity against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Pallant and Steenkamp, 2008), while the aqueous extract was found completely inactive (Almagboul et al., 1985). Acetone and hexane extracts showed an anti-mycobacterium tuberculosis activity with MIC of greater than 100 \u03bc/ml (Green et al., 2010), while the hexane extract showed significant activity against Mycobacterium bovis BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra with minimum MIC of 15.6 to 62.5 \u00b5g/mL (Luo et al., 2011). The dichloromethane extract of the roots at a dose of 150 mg/kg significantly reduced parasitemia in mice experimentally infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Aderbauer et al., 2008). The trypanocidal and cytotoxic activities of the plant have also been demonstrated by Nibret et al., (2009); the dichloromethane extract showed a trypanocidal activity with an IC50 less than 20 \u03bcg/ml. Akinmoladun et al. (2010) have also demonstrated the plant\u2019s antioxidant activity. Oral administration of a root decoction produced a sedative, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects in a dose-dependent manner (Adeyemi et al., 2010; Oliver-Bever, 1986). The compound securinine showed in vitro antimalarial activity on Plasmodium falciparum (Weenen et al. 1990) and the acid derivatives of quinine isolated from the roots exhibited anti-HIV activity in vitro (Mahmood et al., 1993). The plant also has activity against the polio virus at a concentration between 10 and 50 mg/ml (Beuscher et al., 1994). Extracts of the roots have proteolytic, analgesic, antiinflammatory, antioxidant and hypoglycaemic properties (Muanda, et al., 2010; Ojewole, 2008; Bah, 2006).\n\n\n\n",

        "Therapeutic indications": "\n\nPains, worm infestation, rheumatism, psoriasis, eczema and immunosuppressive diseases, leprosy, wounds\n\n\n\n",
        "Safety data": "\n\nIn a 24-hour acute toxicity study, the LD50 of the aqueous root extract (p.o) in mice was >2000 mg/kg. Subacute studies did not show any clinical signs of toxicity after treatment of male and female mice (500 to 2000 mg/kg; p.o) for 14 days. Oral intake of aqueous root extract over 28 days, caused toxicity by decreasing the antioxidant system in the treated animals (Ajiboye et al. 2010). The minimum lethal dose in rats in 24 hours of raw ethanol stem bark extract was 50 mg/kg (Sandberg and Cronlund, 1982). Some active saponins from the root are highly toxic: LD50 of 500 mg/kg administered when orally and 50 mg/kg parenterally in mice (Tubery, 1969). The LD50 of saponin-rich crude fresh root extract was 0.875/kg by oral adminstration. Ingestion of the root by mouth produces irritation of the digestive tract, which can be fatal causing death after 19 hours; humans have a much more sensitive response with oral LD50 = 170 mg/Kg (Scandola et al., 1994).  Leaves are less toxic than the stem and root; LD50 of the freeze-dried macerated aqueous extract is 5g/kg oral or 53.76 g/kg (Scandola et al., 1994). Securinine has a very high toxicity; doses of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg to 5-30 mg cause death by respiratory arrest (Chang Hui-yun, 1974).\n\n\n\n",

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nThe leaves are used for dermatitis, eczema, ringworm, intestinal helminthiasis, taeniasis, constipation, asthma, gonorrhoea, bronchitis, delayed labour and as an abortifacient (OliverBever, 1986; Hauptman and Lacerda, 1950).\n\n\n\nBiological and Pharmacological activities Several laboratory reports have lent support to some of the herbs\u2019 folkloric claims. The anthranoid glycosides cause purgation by stimulating peristalsis in the large bowel and diminishing water absorption. Extracts of various parts of the plant have shown promising antimicrobial and analgesic properties (Palanichamy and Nagarajan, 1991) and laxative activities (Ogunti and Elujoba, 1993; Nickell,\n\n1959). Alcoholic extract of the leaf and flower of S. alata showed antimicrobial activity on unspecified Gram-positive bacteria (Benjamin and Lamikanra, 1981). In a study by Crockett in 1992, extracts were reported to be effective in treating the opportunistic infections of AIDS. Ethanolic extracts exhibited high antimicrobial activity against various species of dermatophytic fungi but low activity against non-dermatophytic fungi; bacterial and yeast species showed resistance to the extract in vitro (Ibrahim, 1995).  The ethanolic leaf extract showed low MIC values of 12.5-25.0 mg/ml against Trichophyton rubrum and Basidiobolus haptosporus (Lemli, 1976). The leaf extract also showed maximum analgesic activity in vivo compared to kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside with morphine (Palanichamy and Nagarajan, 1990). Oil extracted from the leaf had inhibitory effects on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (Okafor et al., 2001).\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nIn a multicentre randomized controlled trial, leaf infusions administered at bed-time was found to have stronger purgative action compared to placebo. A small percentage of the participants (16-25%) were reported to have experienced minimal side effects, i.e., nausea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain and diarrhoea (Thamlikitkul et al., 1990). A 10-year human study found the leaf extract to be an effective antifungal agent for the treatment of Pityriasis versicolor (Damodaran and Venkataraman, 1994). Oladele et al., (2010, 2012) reported on an observational clinical study with Senna alata herbal soaps for the management of superfacial skin infections among the prison inmates. It significantly cleared the lesions on 94% of the patients in 4 weeks, mainly comprising of Taenia vesicolor and T. corporis as the causative infections. In a related study by the same research group, 3% Senna alata incorporated into the herbal soap, gave the best result among the other 2 herbal soaps\n\n(Oladele et al., 2012).\n\n\n\n",

Senna stimulates peristaltic contraction, significantly increasing the rate of defaecation, faecal weight and stool fluidity (Fleming, 2000).\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nThe time of action of senna is usually 8-10 hours, and thus the dose should be taken at night.  The action of the sennosides augments, without disrupting, the response to the physiological stimuli of food and physical activity.  The sennosides abolish the severe constipation of patients suffering from severe irritable bowel syndrome.  In therapeutic doses, the sennosides do not disrupt the usual pattern of defecation times and markedly soften the stool.  Sennosides significantly increase the rate of colonic transit and increase colonic peristalsis, which in turn increase both faecal weight and dry bacterial mass.

        "Definition of plant material of interest": "Coffee senna consists of the dried leaf of Senna occidentalis (L.) Link (Leguminosae-\n\nCeasalpinioideae).\n\n\n\n",
        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nS. occidentalis is used in many parts of Africa to treat a range of conditions such as abscesses, bruises, cataracts, constipation, eye infections, headache, jaundice, kidney infections, leprosy, malaria, kidney pain, menstrual disorders, rheumatism, ringworm, scabies, sore throat, stomach ulcers, stomachache, syphilis, tetanus, worms, fevers, tuberculosis, anaemia, liver, disorders; general weakness; asthma; bronchitis; venereal diseases (Chukwujekwu et al., 2005; Tona et al., 2004; Samy and Ignacimuthu, 2000; Kuo et al., 1996; Soukup, 1970; Rutter 1990; Coimbra, 1994; Ayensu, 1981; Altschul, 1983; Ronquillo, 1988; Robineau, 1989; Standley and Steyermark, 1946; Kabiruddin, 1951; Kirthikar et al 1969). In Mali, the leaves are used to treat oedema and a decoction is made for malaria, fevers in pregnancy, yellow fever, headache and conjunctivitis. The seeds are brewed into a coffee-like beverage for asthma, hypertension, malaria, fevers and stomach complaints.\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "\n\nThe laxative effect of the various parts of the Senna plant was reported as far back as the 1950s (Grote and Woods, 1951). Several scientific investigations have shown that S. occidentalis has antibiotic, antiinflammatory, anthelmintic, abortifacient, cholagogic, cicatrizant, diuretic, laxative and tonic properties (Ake, 1983; Morton, 1981; Robineau 1989; Chukwujekwu et al 2006). The aerial parts of the plant (leaves, fruits and leaves) have purgative properties (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962). Extracts of the leaf exhibited broad spectrum antibacterial activity against B. subtilis and S. aureus (Samy and Ignacimuthu, 2000) and the benzene and ether extracts of the leaves, root and seeds were also active against Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria (Ikram et al 1978). It showed antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhi (Perez and Anesini, 1994; Evans et al., 2002). A study by Tona et al (1999) also showed that the ethanol and\n\ndichloromethane leaf extracts possessed antiparasitic effect in vitro, whilst the ethanolic, dichloromethane and lyophilized aqueous extracts of the root bark produced\n\nchemosuppressions of parasitaemia in a dosedependent manner; the ethanolic lipophilised extract was more active (Tona et al., 1999; Tona et al., 2001; Tona et al., 2004). However, Gasquet et al (1993), reported mild antimalarial effects.  Another study by Caceres et al., (199lc) found that the leaf decoction was active against E. flocossum, M. gypseum, T. mentagrophytes and T. rubrum. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that aqueous extracts of the plant possess anti-mutagenic activity against benzo[\u03b1]pyrene and cyclophosphamide-induced mutagenicity (Sharma et al 1999; Sharma et al 2000a; Sharma, et al., 2001).\n\nCyclophosphamide-exposed animals showed enhanced immunity on administration of the plant extracts (Bin-Hafeez et al 2001). In vivo studies have also shown that the plant\u2019s powder has antiinflammatory activity, as well as an ability to stabilize human erythrocyte membrane against hypotonicity-induced lysis (Sadique et al., 1987). The leaf extracts produced significant hepatoprotection (Jafri et al., 1999) while its aqueous extract exhibited significant antihyperglycaemic activity in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats (Verma et al., 2010). Aqueous extract of the whole plant, also had more potential than hydro-alcoholic and alcoholic extracts against human cancer cell lines at 100, 30, and 10 \u03bcg/ml. The hydroalcoholic extract showed potential against Bacillus subtillis (Bhagat and Saxena, 2010), whilst ethyl acetate fraction of the leaf methanolic extract exhibited the high antioxidant potential of the plant (El-Hashash et al., 2011). Aqueous and hydro-alcoholic extracts of C. occidentalis induced complete inhibition of egg hatching at a concentration less than or equal to 1mg/ml.  Aqueous extract also induced 96.36% inhibition of larval development, but hydro-alcoholic extracts of the plant (9%) had poor inhibitory effect (Eguale et al., 2011).\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nThe efficacy of S. occidentalis as a stimulant for skin repigmentation in vitiligo was demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies (Babitha et al., 2011).\n\n\n\n",
        "Chemical constituents": "\n\nAnthraquinone (e.g. the sennosides, chrysophanol, physcion, helminthosporin, emodin), fatty oils, flavonoids ((jaceine 7rhamnoside, mattencinol 7-rhamnoside, matteucinol 7-rhamnoside, jaceidin-7rhamnoside, cassiaoccidentalins A, B and C), xanthones (cassiollin); gallactomannan, polysaccharides and tannins) (Chukwujekwu et al., 2006; Chauhan et al., 2001; Purwar et al., 2003; Hatano et al., 1999; Ikram et al., 1978; Glasby, 1991; Rai and Shok, 1983; Gupta et al., 2005).\n\n\n\n\n\nTests for identity and purity\n\nMoisture content: 8.84%\n\nTotal ash: 11.54 %\n\nWater-soluble extractive: not less than 21.64%\n\nAlcohol-soluble (70%) extractive: not less than\n\n21.17%\n\n\n\n",

        "Safety data": "\n\nThe LD50 of the aqueous extract of leaves (p.o) in mice over a period of 24 hours was >2000 mg/kg. Sub-acute studies did not show any clinical signs of toxicity after treatment of male and female mice (500 to 2000 mg/kg; p.o) for 14 days. In a sub-chronic toxicity study, repeated administration of the aqueous extract can cause hypoglycemia and liver and kidney dysfunction in rats. The toxicity of the fresh or dried beans was demonstrated in several animal studies. The LD50 is 1 g/kg for mice and rats. Toxicity is attributed to alkaloids, various anthraquinones and their derivatives, but the specific toxins have not been identified. The clinical spectrum and histopathology of S. occidentalis poisoning in children resemble those of animal toxicity, affecting mainly hepatic, skeletal muscle and brain tissues. The case-fatality rate in acute severe poisoning is 75-80% in children (Vashishtha et al., 2009). Ingestion of large doses of the leaves may expose people to the risk of hepatotoxicity (Vanderperren et al. 2005; Borrelli et al., 2005; Nuhu and Aliyu, 2008). Acute toxicity studies carried out in rats revealed that the hydroalcoholic extracts of stem and leaf were well tolerated, the LD50 were higher than 5 g/kg. Oral subacute administration during pregnancy in female Wistar rats showed no statistically significant differences between the control and treated groups in terms of offspring/dam relationship; foetuses, placentae and ovarian weight; number of implantation and resorption sites; number of corpora lutea in the ovaries and pre- and post-implantation loss rates (Arag\u00e3o, et al., 2009). Subacute treatment with the hydroalcoholic extracts of stem and leaf failed to change body weight gain, food and water consumption and haematological and biochemical profiles; no changes in macroscopic and microscopic features of organs were observed in the rats (Silva et al. 2011).\n\n\n\n",
        "Precautions for use": "\n\nThe aqueous extract of the plant can cause hypoglycaemia and increased hepatic and renal function. Blood glucose and the biochemical parameters of liver and kidney need to be regularly monitored on prolonged use\n\n",
        "Adverse effects": "\n\nLong term ingestion of small amounts and single high dose of the seed caused myodegeneration, respiratory failure, disruption of mitochondrial structure and death in rabbits (O\u2019Hara and Pierce, 1974). High doses can interfere with the metabolism of some drugs in the liver.\n\n\n\n",

It produced a significant laxative activity at\n\n500 mg/kg in rats with a biological Sennaequivalent of 0.8 or percentage Senna-activity of 80%; it is devoid of geographical or seasonal variation in the laxative effect, but young leaves produced higher laxative activity than old leaves (Elujoba et al, 1989). Both aqueous infusion and methanolic extract of S. podocarpa showed in vitro antidiarrhoeal effect (Akomolafe et al., 2004). A suspension of the powdered leaf produced wet faeces in mice (Larbi and Lewis, 1976).

It is now a pantropical weed; in West and Central Africa it is a kitchen garden crop, and probably occurs in other regions of Africa as well. S. torvum establishes itself on open land in disturbed soil, on roadsides, brushy pastures, recently abandoned farmland, river banks and wastelands, where it often turns into a weed that becomes hard to control. In Cameroon it is a characteristic pioneer species on fallow land. It is listed as a noxious weed in the south-eastern United States. It is normally found either near wetlands or in high rainfall areas, mainly in lowland regions, yet it is tolerant of dry periods (www.prota.org).

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nSolanum fruits, flowers and stems possess carminative, anthelmintic and bitter properties. The root is expectorant and used in the treatment of chest pain due to cough, asthma and bronchitis. The leaves are applied externally as a pain relieving agent. Different parts of the plant are used worldwide as an antidote for poison and for the treatment of fever, wounds, tooth ache, gastric ulceration, skin diseases, reproductive disorders, fever and arterial hypertension (Noumi et al., 1999; Noumi and Dibakto, 2000; Noumi, 2004; Ndebia et al., 2007; Muthu et al., 2006; Kala, 2005). In the treatment of female infertility, 3 or 4 g of fruit are macerated in palm wine and administered orally (Telefo et al., 2011). The fruits are boiled with leaves and a cupful of the decoction drunk to treat malaria (Asase et al., 2010). The leaves are used in Central America, India, and Gabon to treat cuts and wounds and diabetes. In Sierra Leone, the fruit decoction is given to children suffering from cough, whereas in Senegal the plant is used to treat sore throat and stomachache. In the Philippines, roots of S. torvum are used for stomach ache, while the decoction is drunk for indigestion, gastric pain at the navel, rheumatism, numbness, contusion, lumbar muscular pains, and amenorrhoea. Decoction is used in some areas to lessen postpartum haemorrhage.\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Isoflavonoid torvanol A and the steroidal glycoside torvoside H isolated from the fruits showed antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 (www.prota.org).  The glycoalkaloid solasodine present in the leaves and fruits is used in India for the production of steroidal sex hormones for oral contraceptives\n\n(www.prota.org). Methanolic extract of the fruits showed a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activities. Studies on the effect of dried leaf powder in India showed no significant changes with respect to glucose, lipid profile, total amino acids and uronic acid levels in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patients (www.prota.org). The ethanol extract exhibited potent platelet aggregating effects, and the aqueous leaf extract showed both analagesic and antiinflammatory properties. Methanolic extract reduced blood pressure, vascular reactivity changes to catecholamines and reversed metabolic alterations induced by fructose. S. torvum had catalytic inhibiting and antioxidant activity (Kusirisin et al., 2009). In an in vitro study against human pathogenic strains, the water and ethanol extract was found effective against all bacterial strains with an inhibition comparable to that of commercial antibiotics. Methanolic extracts of the roots exhibited promising antibacterial and antifungal effects on all test organisms. The methanol extract at the dose of 750 mg/kg produced significant inhibition of HCl/ethanol-, indomethacin-, pylorus ligation- and stress-induced gastric ulcerations. All the fractions of the methanol extract significantly inhibited ulcer formation. Fruit extracts exhibited hypertensive effects in vitro and in vivo (Nguelefack et al. 2009).\n\n\n\n",

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nReported to be antiabortive, cyanogenetic, demulcent, diuretic, emollient, intoxicant, and poison, sorghum is a folk remedy for cancer, epilepsy and stomachache (Duke and Wain, 1981). While the root is used for malaria in Zimbabwe, the seed is indicated for breast disorders and diarrheoa and the stem for tubercular swellings. In India, the plant is considered anthelminthic and insecticidal, and in South Africa, in combination with Erigeron canadense L., it is used for eczema. In China, where the seeds are used to make alcohol, the seed husk is braised in brown sugar with a little water and applied to the chest of measles patients. The seeds are considered beneficial in fluxes (Perry, 1980). The leaf decoction is used to treat measles (Morton (1981), while a powdered mixture of the seeds and the calabash tree (Cresentia) is a treatment for lung ailments. In Venezuela, the seeds are toasted and pulverized for diarrhoea and in Brazil the seed decoction is used for bronchitis, cough and other chest ailments. Hot oil packs of the seeds are applied to the back of patients with pulmonary congestion. Grieve (1984), recommends that a decoction of about 50 g seed be boiled in a liter of water to about 1/2 liter for the treatment of kidney and urinary disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Aqueous stem bark extracts of S. bicolor at doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg body weight showed anti-anaemic properties in iron deficient weaning rats (Oladiji et al., 2007). Antioxidant activity of the methanolic extracts has been demonstrated in vitro (Hegde and Chandra 2005). A peptide isolated from the plant strongly inhibited the replication of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in a dose-dependent manner. The peptide also had an in vitro prophylactic effect against HSV-1 infection (Filho et al., 2008). The decoction of the plant exhibited membrane stabilizing activity in vitro and could therefore help to stabilize red blood cells from stress injury (Falade et al., 2005). Cho et al., (2000) observed that feeding rats with whole sorghum, proso millet or buckwheat caused increased faecal bile acid excretion and HDL cholesterol levels without a change in total cholesterol. However it was found that both high-tannin and non-tannin sorghums as well as wheat bran increased blood serum total cholesterol in rats. Lee and Pan (2003) have also shown that dietary tanninsorghum distillery residues had antioxidant activity by their ability to inhibit haemoglobincatalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid and significantly improve blood-thinning and erythrocyte membrane integrity of the fish blood cells during winter. There have been several reports on reduced weight gain of animals fed high tannin sorghum (Cousins et al., 1981; Lizardo et al., 1995; Al-Mamary et al., 2001; Muriu et al., 2002). In vitro studies have also revealed anti-carcinogenic properties of sorghum. Grimmer et al., (1992) demonstrated anti-mutagenicity of sorghum polyphenol extracts.\n\n\n\n",

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nVarious parts of S. campanulata are used in African traditional medicine for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including dysentery, gastritis, ulcers, pelvic pain in women, headache, oedema, dermatitis, guinea worm. The stem bark is applied as a paste to treat wounds (Mensah et al., 2003). The macerated leaf is used against urethritis and as an antidote for poison. The bark decoction is used for kidney problems, swelling and skin complaints (Irvin, 1961) and the stem bark is used as an enema in diabetes (Niyonzima, 1997). The macerated bark of the trunk is a remedy for infectious diseases including sexually transmitted infections (Magassouba et al., 2007). In Ghana, the plant is used for the treatment of dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, arthritis, fracture, toothache, stomach ache and stomach ulcer (Agbovie et al., 2002).\n\n\n\nBiological and Pharmacological activities A bioactivity-guided fractionation led to the isolation of mainly polysaccharides that have shown strong and reproducible hypoglycaemic activity (Niyonzima et al., 1999; Niyonzima, 1997). The methanol extract of the stem bark showed antimicrobial, antifungal (Trichophyton sp), antioxidant effects in vitro (Mensah et al., 2003; 2006) and  wound healing properties in vivo (Sy et al., 2005). The cerebrosides significantly inhibited the growth of many Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria (Mboso et al., 2008). The plant is known to be active against Pseudomonas solanecearum (Amusan et al., 1994). The antimalarial activity of stem bark extract on mice infected with Plasmodium berghei berghei has been reported (Makinde et al., 1988). The leaf extract has been shown to possess analgesic effects. Ofori-Kwakye et al, (2009) reported the antimicrobial activity of the stem bark extracts against four strains of bacteria and a yeast, Candida albicans. S. campanulata, and Hoslundia opposita and Pycnanthus angolensis, which are commonly used by traditional medicine practitioners in Ghana for wound healing in case of stomach ulcers, demonstrated strong antiadhesive activity against Helicobacter pylori (Agyare et al., 2009).\n\n\n\n",

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nIn Mali, the plant is used to treat tooth decay; it is also used as a diuretic, laxative and purgative and febrifuge (Adjanohoun et al., 1979). The leaf extracts have potent antimicrobial and antifungal properties. The juice obtained by expression of the fresh leaves is commonly used in Senegal for the treatment of eye diseases, while the leaf or root bud decoction is prescribed for diarrhoea and dysentery or macerated for colic pain (Kerharo and Adam, 1974). The decoction of the leaves with added salt has diuretic and laxative properties (Adjanohoun et al, 1979). The leaf decoction is also a remedy for caries, dental abscesses, colic, various eye diseases and toothache (Boullard, 2001). The bark infusion is used as a mouthwash against toothache and as an anthelmintic; the decoction of the bark is used in cough with severe inflammatory symptoms, and vomiting. The dried bark is used as a spray on fresh wounds of circumcision and the stem bark is used as a tea for pregnant women\n\n(Boullard, 2001).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "The leaf extract of S. mombin exhibited wide spectrum antibacterial effects comparable to those of ampicillin and gentamycin (Abo et al., 1999). Cold water, hot water and ethanolic extracts of the plant did not inhibit cariogenic streptococci isolated from dental caries patients (Amadi et al., 2007). Caffeoyl esters and ellagitannins present in the plant exhibited pronounced antiviral activity against Coxsackie and Herpes simplex viruses (Corthout et al., 1991; 1992). A series of 6-alkenylsalicylic acids isolated from the ethanolic extract of leaves and stems of S. Mombin were shown to have a pronounced antibacterial effect against Bacillus cereus, \tStreptococcus \tpyogenes, \tand Mycobacterium fortuitum and a molluscicidal effect against the snail Biophalaria glabrata, an intermediate host in the schistosome life cycle (Corthout et al., 1994).  A phytotherapeutic gel comprising of a hydroalcoholic extract of S. mombin together with chitosan demonstrated antiviral activity against Herpes simplex. Oral administration of a single dose of pectins obtained from the plant caused significant decrease in blood sugar levels in alloxaninduced diabetic rats (El Fiki, 2000). The aqueous, methanol and ethanol extracts possess anxiolytic \teffect \tmediated \tby \tGABAergic transmission \tas \twell \tas \tsedative \tand antidopaminergic effects (Ayoka et al., 2005; 2006).

Aqueous extract of the pod is used as anticonvulsant whilst its paste is used to treat rheumatism. The intense odour on roasting is claimed to have insect- and snake-repellent properties (Gill, 1992). In some parts of West Africa, the fruit serves as a a spice or as a source of multivitamins. In eastern parts of Nigeria, fruits are used to prepare soups for mothers from the first day of delivery to prevent postpartum contraction.\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Saponins from T. tetraptera are among the most powerful natural molluscicides (Maillard et al., 1989; Adewunmi et al., 1982). Methanolic extracts of the leaf, leaf stalk, stem-bark, rootbark and fruit possess molluscicidal activity (Adewunmi, 1999; Ngazzapa et al., 1989) against a variety of freshwater snails including Bulinus globosus, Lymnaea natalensis, L. columella, and Physa waterlotti (Adewunmi and Marquis, 1981; Adewunmi et al., 1982; Adewunmi et al., 1989). Aqueous extract of the plant is also effective against Bulinus globosus (Adewunmi and Marquis, 1987). Application of the aqueous extract to a snail-infested site reduced field snail population and kept the transmission sites free from schistosome cercariae production for about 28 days (Adewunmi, 1984; Adewunmi and Furu, 1989). Studies have shown that planting of T. tetraptera along water courses has potential for the local control of schistosomiasis (Adewunmi, 1991).\n\nThe triterpenoid saponin aridanin is thought to be\n\n\n\nresponsible for the molluscicidal activity of the\n\nWater-soluble extractive: Not less than 14.60%\n\nfruit (Adesina and Reisch, 1985; Mailard et al.,\n\nAlcohol-soluble (70%) extractive: Not less than\n\n1989).

Some sesquiterpenes and steroidal constituents exhibited antiplasmodial activity in vitro (Phillipson et al.,1993); the sesquiterpene lactones, vernolide and vernodalol demonstrated significant bactericidal and antifungal activity (Erasto et al., 2006). The leaf extracts containing luteolins showed antioxidant properties in vitro (Igile et al., 1994) and ethanolic root extracts provided protection against pentylenetetrazoleinduced lethality. The extracts also had antipyretic and analgesic effects (Okokon and Onah, 2004). Various extracts of V. amygdalina have been shown to possess antibacterial and anti-leishmanial, antimutagenic, antioxidant and anti-cancer effects (Erasto et al., 2007; Izevbige, 2003; Iwalokun et al., 2003; Akinpelu 1999; Obaseiki-Ebor et al., 1993; Tadesse et al., 1993).\n\nThe compound elamanolide has insect antifeedant properties (Ganjian, 1983). Leaf extracts of the plant showed inhibitory activity against Trichomonas vaginalis (Hakizamungu et al.,1992). Vernodaline and vernolide had antitumour properties in leukaemia cells (Jisaka et al., 1993), while the crude extracts inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells (Izevbigie, 2003). Aqueous leaf extracts containing peptides and edotides inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells (Atanaskova et al., 2002; Mandlekar and Kong, 2001). The sesquiterpenone-rich chloroform extract demonstrated cytotoxic activity in human carcinoma nasopharynx cells (Kupchan et al., 1969). Aqueous extract induced an increase in acid output and caused contraction of the guinea pig ileum (Owu et al., 2008). Aqueous leaf extracts of the plant lowered blood sugar levels of normoglycaemic and alloxan diabetic rabbits (Akah and Okafor, 1992) and STZ-induced diabetic mice and rats (NIPRD Technical Report, 2006). A methanol extract of V. amygdalina leaves exhibited a carthatic effect in the charcoal meal test in mice (Awe et al., 1999).\n\n\n\n",

The leaves have a sweet and bitter taste; they are sold fresh or dried, and are a common ingredient in soup. V. colorata has long been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of cough, fever, hepatitis, gastritis, stomachache, diabetes, colic, rheumatism, dysentery, ulcerative colitis, venereal diseases, diarrhoea, boils and skin eruptions (Hutchings et al., 1996). Leaf infusions or decoctions are used as mouth wash for tonsillitis, earache and fever. The fresh leaf extract is applied to wounds (Kerharo and Adam, 1974; Ake Assi and Guinko, 1986; Oliver-Bever, 1996; Adjanohoun et al., 1985).\n\n\n\n",

A study by Kraft et al. (2003) showed that the lipophilic extracts from the aerial parts, the plant\u2019s sesquiterpene lactones, as well as isolated phenylpropanoids and terpenoids possess potent antiplasmodial activity. The sesquiterpene lactones also possess anthelmintic, amoebicidal, antischistosomal, plasmodicidal, leishmanicidal and muscle relaxant properties in vitro and in vivo (Campos, et al, 2003; Gasquet, et al., 1985; Toubiana and Gaudemer, 1967; Kupchan et al., 1969; Asaka et al., 1977). Dichloromethane, acetone and ethanol extracts exhibited a promising anti-toxoplasma activity. The leaf extracts possess potent antibacterial activity against various bacteria strains (Kelmanson et al., 2000). Vernodalin isolated from the leaves has significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (Reid et al., 2001), while aqueous, methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts were active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Jonathan et al., 2000). Stafford et al. (2005) found that aqueous, ethanol and hexane extracts of fresh, 90-day-old and 1-year-old material had antibacterial activity. Different extracts of the leaves also possess both hypoglycaemic and antidiabetic effects in normoglycaemic and alloxan-induced diabetic rats (Sy et al., 2004; 2005; 2006).\n\n\n\n",

        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Z. xanthoxyloides has antifungal, antibacterial, antisickling and antileukaemic properties. Aqueous-ethanolic root and stem bark extracts have dose-dependent antifungal effects in vitro (Ngane et al., 2000); the essential oil also has antibacterial and antifungal activity (Tatsadjieu, 2003; Ngassoum et al., 2003). The ether fraction of the aqueous root extract showed antisickling activity (Osoba et al., 1989), by normalising sickled HbAS, HbSS and crenated HbAA red blood cells in vitro (Sofowora, 2002). Cells treated with the extract changed from sickled cells to round (Headings et al., 1979); other studies have found that the extract is non-toxic to whole animals (Isaacs-Sodoye et al., 1975). The compound fagaronine is antileukaemic (Messner et al., 1972) and the chlorides of nitidine and fagaronine have avian myeloblastosis and reverse transcriptase inhibitory effects (AddaeMensah et al., 1992).\n\n\n\n",

In subacute studies, no clinical signs of toxicity were seen on repeated administration of 300-3000 mg/kg for 14 days. No significant changes in body weight or relative organ weights were observed; an increase in WBC, LYM, NEUT and MCV was recorded; increased levels of liver transaminases (AST, ALP, ALT and GGT) were seen at the highest dose (3000 mg/kg) tested, but while albumin levels reduced, serum urea increased at 3000 mg/kg. Other toxicological studies also showed that the extract did not have toxic effects in duck and chick embryo as well as in mice. No teratogenic features were observed in the whole embryos; no deaths were recorded in acute toxicity oral studies at up to 50 g/kg. LD50 by intraperitoneal route was 20 g/kg; by intravenous, route was 8 g/kg while the LD100 by the later route was 14 g/kg. Chronic toxicity studies showed no pathological changes (IsaacsSodeye et al., 1975).

        "Ethnomedical uses": "\n\nGinger is used in the treatment of a wide range of diseases including rectal prolapse, toothache, voice hoarseness, cough, colds, flu, pregnancyinduced nausea and vomiting, asthma, fever, colic, dysmenorrhoea, diarrhoea, arthritis, hepatitis, dyspepsia (Samy, 2005; Milt and Bone, 2001; Adjanahoun et al, 1985; BHP, 1983).\n\n\n\n",
        "Biological and pharmacological activities": "Ginger has diverse phytopharmacological properties. It has circulatory, digestive, central nervous system and gastrointestinal stimulating actions; it increases peristalsis and promotes bile secretion. In vitro studies have shown that many constituents of ginger have antiinflammatory properties (Grzanna et al, 2005; Srivastava and Mustafa, 1989); ginger extracts possess platelet aggregation and thromboxane synthesis inhibitory effects in vitro (Guh et al. 1995; Kiuchi et al., 1992; Srivastava, 1986). In vitro studies have shown that ginger exhibits its antiinflammatory effects by inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism in both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways (Backon, 1986).   single oral dose of 33 mg/kg ginger oil significantly suppressed severe chronic adjuvant arthritis in rats (Sharma et al., 1994). The benzene fraction of a petroleum ether extract of dried rhizomes potentiated diazepam-induced motor incoordination in vitro (Vishwakarma et al., 2000). Extracts of ginger showed significant dose-dependent antiemetic effects against cisplatin-induced emesis in healthy dogs (Sharma et al., 1997). Pre-treatment with ginger extract and ginger juice partially reversed inhibition of gastric emptying following cisplatin administration (Sharma and Gupta, 1998). Extracts of ginger have antioxidant (Goyal and Kadnur, 2006; Masuda et al., 2004; Kikuzaki et al., 1994), radioprotective and neuromodulatory properties (Haksar et al., 2006); ethanol extracts demonstrated hepatoprotective activity against acetaminophen-induced acute toxicity (Ajith et al., 2007a). The extract alone and in combination with vitamin E partially ameliorated cisplatininduced nephrotoxicity (Ajith et al., 2007b). Ethanolic extract of the plant has also shown antihyperlipidaemic activity in vitro (Bhandari et al., 1998), while the volatile oil has been found to influence both cell-mediated immune response and nonspecific proliferation of T lymphocyte (Zhou et al., 2006). Ginger has also been found to have anticancer properties in vitro and in vivo (Bode et al., 2001; Katiyar et al., 1996; Koshimizu et al. 1988); the compound [6]gingerol has been shown to inhibit cell adhesion, invasion and motility in human breast cancer cell lines (Lee et al., 1998).\n\n\n\n",
        "Clinical data": "\n\nIn a small scale study, daily intake of 15 g raw ginger rhizome or 40 g cooked rhizome by 18 healthy volunteers for two weeks did not decrease platelet cyclooxygenase activity (Janssen et al.,1996). Administration of a single dose of 2 g of the dried rhizome or placebo to eight healthy volunteers produced no differences in bleeding time, platelet count, and platelet functioning. A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study that compared ginger extracts and ibuprofen or placebo in individuals with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, found no significant improvement in symptoms for both the ginger and ibuprofen groups before crossover with no difference between ginger and placebo at the end of the study (Bliddal et al., 2000). In another double-blind randomized, placebocontrolled study, pre-treatment of volunteers with a history of motion sickness with ginger, produced significant protection against nausea (Lien et al., 2003). Other double-blind studies have also shown the effectiveness of ginger against motion sickness; a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial involving 26 women in the first trimester of pregnancy who took one tablespoon of ginger syrup containing 1 g ginger or placebo four times daily found that while daily vomiting ceased in 8 women in the ginger group by the sixth day, only 2 in the placebo group reported cessation of vomiting. Also, while 77% taking the ginger syrup reported a significant decrease in nausea, 20% in the placebo group reported improvement. In another study in which 70 pregnant women received either 250 mg freshly prepared ginger powder or a placebo, a significant reduction in nausea and number of vomiting episodes was observed (Vutyavanich et al., 2001). In two double-blind studies performed on women following major gynaecological surgery, nausea was observed in the placebo group throughout the duration of the study, but only 28% experienced nausea in the ginger group and 30% in the metoclopramide group (Bone et al., 1990). In a randomized, doubleblind, crossover trial involving 27 women women who had been admitted to hospital for treatment of the most severe form of hyperemesis gravidarum, adminstration of 250 mg of ginger in a capsule four times daily produced a significant reduction in the symptoms of hyperemesis (Murphy, 1998). A significant reduction in nausea and vomiting was observed in the ginger group, compared to placebo and metoclopramide (Phillips et al., 1993). In another double-blind trial of chemotherapy-induced nausea in which 41 patients with leukaemia received either ginger or a placebo after administration of compazine (Pace, 1987), a greater symptomatic benefit was observed in the ginger group compared to placebo. Ginger consumption ameliorated the pain and symptoms of rheumatic disorders (Srivastava and Mustafa, 1992). Ginger has been shown to be an effective remedy for reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting (Chaiyakunapruk et al., 2006).\n\n\n\n",
